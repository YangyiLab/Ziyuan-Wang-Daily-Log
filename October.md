## Rafael D'Andrea LAB
Our model simulates stochastic niche assembly (Tilman, 2004) under external immigration. Coexistence in this context means the sustained presence of multiple species in a focal community for a long period of time (in our case, hundreds of thousands of years), with the forces that tend to reduce species richness—competitive exclusion and demographic stochasticity—being offset by the stabilizing effects of niche differentiation and immigration.

 #### introduction

 paragraph1 bacillus
 
Bacillus is one of the important bacteria that hitchhiking phenomenon occurs in soil, for example, Streptomyces spores are transported to plant tissues by Streptomyces spores attach to Bacillus.

 paragraph3 

 There is clear evidence that plants shape microbiome structures, most probably by root exudates, and also that bacteria have developed various adaptations to thrive in the rhizospheric niche.  Besides, plants block a majority of microbes at the front line by a non-host resistance strategy, this natural immunity affects the growth of microbial populations in the soil. These studies suggest that plant research influences microbial communities, but no relevant studies have revealed the relationship between plants and hitchhiking.

 **植物影响微生物群落，字数不够，保证每段字数差不太多，举例说明，比如说某种菌是如何被植物影响的**

 paragraph4 
 
 研究说明：改成植物和氮肥协同作用，删掉真菌的部分

 We proposed that under the synergistic effect of nitrogen application concentration and plant, rhizosphere microbial migration and hitchhiking activities were affected, leading to changes in rhizosphere bacterial communities, and thus affecting plant growth.We present findings from a long-term longitudinal field study, in which three different nitrogen fertilizer concentrations were applied to different groups, and 0.45-μm filter membranes were utilized to prevent microbe movement through the soil. We used a molecular barcoding approach to assess bacterial diversity patterns using DNA directly extracted from bulk soil as the template to amplify the 16S rRNA gene region by PCR.Then, high-throughput sequencing of the obtained amplicons was performed to illustrate the changes in the bulk soil and rhizosphere microbial communities under different nitrogen concentrations and with or without spinach planting . Furthermore, the mechanism responsible for the effects of filter membrane applications near rhizosphere soil exposed to various nitrogen concentrations and with or without spinach planting on plant growth was investigated. We assessed the current co-occurrence network and studied the activation of the symbiotic mode under various nitrogen concentrations and with or without spinach cultivation, and we found that nitrogen concentration and with or without spinach cultivation changes influenced both motile and their associated non-motile bacteria.

### introduction
完善例子
Maize plants release a blend of metabolites, including BXs , from the roots and thereby influence the composition of the root-associated microbiota.

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-05122-7\

The composition of root exudates varies from plant to plant and affects the relative abundance of microorganisms in the vicinity of the root, plants not only can provide nutrients for microorganisms, but some plant species also contain unique antimicrobial metabolites in their exudates.

软件有问题 所以

**reason1**

Previous studies have suggested that root length and root surface area were increased under intermediate N levels and that root growth was reduced under both higher and lower fertilization levels. However, high N availability and its concomitant affect root and shoot biomass production

https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0171321

Nitrogen is known to be functional in the construction of amino acids and chlorophyll, which can influence plant growth and development by affecting photosynthesis and the uptake of minerals [25,26].

Previous studies have suggested that root length and root surface area were increased under intermediate N levels and that root growth was reduced under both higher and lower fertilization levels, so that the plant morphology is affected. On the other hand, Nitrogen is be functional in the construction of amino acids and chlorophyll, which can influence plant growth and development by affecting photosynthesis and the uptake of minerals.

### LTR_finder
安装 需要配置环境变量
1 添加环境变量
vim ~/.bashrc 
export PATH="/usr/local/nginx/sbin/:$PATH"
退出
source ~/.bashrc
### tmux
#### 安装及教程
https://www.ruanyifeng.com/blog/2019/10/tmux.html
#### Tmux查看会话历史输出信息
然后先按快捷键ctrl+b ，然后再按下[，即进入历史输出信息查看模式，可通过键盘上的上下左右键来滚动历史输出信息。
如果要退出查看模式，按下q即可。

### 文献阅读
#### Gene-LTR-retrotransposons in plants: Engines of evolution
http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2017.04.051

#### 重要信息
1 拟南芥中的转座子占拟南芥基因组的 14%以上

2 当转座子以相反方向插入基因内部/靠近基因产生反义转录物/通过将 TEs甲基化延伸到侧翼区域--基因沉默

3 LTR是造成 C 值悖论的主要原因

4 转座子的插入可能会导致--基因功能的改变
插入外显子/内含子；表观遗传沉默；影响转录（超过其正常的终止序列）

 #### introduction

 paragraph1 bacillus
 
Bacillus is one of the important bacteria that hitchhiking phenomenon occurs in soil, for example, Streptomyces spores are transported to plant tissues by Streptomyces spores attach to Bacillus.

 paragraph3 

 There is clear evidence that plants shape microbiome structures, most probably by root exudates, and also that bacteria have developed various adaptations to thrive in the rhizospheric niche.  Besides, plants block a majority of microbes at the front line by a non-host resistance strategy, this natural immunity affects the growth of microbial populations in the soil. These studies suggest that plant research influences microbial communities, but no relevant studies have revealed the relationship between plants and hitchhiking.

 paragraph4 
 
 研究说明：改成植物和氮肥协同作用，删掉真菌的部分

 We proposed that under the synergistic effect of nitrogen application concentration and plant, rhizosphere microbial migration and hitchhiking activities were affected, leading to changes in rhizosphere bacterial communities, and thus affecting plant growth.We present findings from a long-term longitudinal field study, in which three different nitrogen fertilizer concentrations were applied to different groups, and 0.45-μm filter membranes were utilized to prevent microbe movement through the soil. We used a molecular barcoding approach to assess bacterial diversity patterns using DNA directly extracted from bulk soil as the template to amplify the 16S rRNA gene region by PCR.Then, high-throughput sequencing of the obtained amplicons was performed to illustrate the changes in the bulk soil and rhizosphere microbial communities under different nitrogen concentrations and with or without spinach planting . Furthermore, the mechanism responsible for the effects of filter membrane applications near rhizosphere soil exposed to various nitrogen concentrations and with or without spinach planting on plant growth was investigated. We assessed the current co-occurrence network and studied the activation of the symbiotic mode under various nitrogen concentrations and with or without spinach cultivation, and we found that nitrogen concentration and with or without spinach cultivation changes influenced both motile and their associated non-motile bacteria.

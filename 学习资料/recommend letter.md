# Recommendation Letter
## What I have done and learned during the DSML course
+ The basic mathematical principles of machine learning algorithms are explored
+ Through the code of concrete implementation, deepen the mathematical principles of machine learning
+ Deepen the understanding of parameter selection of different machine learning algorithms through statistical principles
+ In the course, I learned how to use visualization to present complex problems to others


## The qualities
+ Willingness to communicate with professors
+ After class, do math proof and material reading
+ Not only the pursuit of practical application, but also theoretical derivation, deepen understanding
+ Take the time to debug and run your own code

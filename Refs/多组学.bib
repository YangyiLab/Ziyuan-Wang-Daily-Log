abstract = {The effects of fertilizer regime on bulk soil microbial communities have been well studied, but this is not the case for the rhizosphere microbiome. The aim of this work was to assess the impact of fertilization regime on wheat rhizosphere microbiome assembly and 16S rRNA gene-predicted functions with soil from the long term Broadbalk experiment at Rothamsted Research. Soil from four N fertilization regimes (organic N, zero N, medium inorganic N and high inorganic N) was sown with seeds of Triticum aestivum cv. Cadenza. 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing was performed with the Illumina platform on bulk soil and rhizosphere samples of 4-week-old and flowering plants (10 weeks). Phylogenetic and 16S rRNA gene-predicted functional analyses were performed. Fertilization regime affected the structure and composition of wheat rhizosphere bacterial communities. Acidobacteria and Planctomycetes were significantly depleted in treatments receiving inorganic N, whereas the addition of high levels of inorganic N enriched members of the phylum Bacteroidetes, especially after 10 weeks. Bacterial richness and diversity decreased with inorganic nitrogen inputs and was highest after organic treatment (FYM). In general, high levels of inorganic nitrogen fertilizers negatively affect bacterial richness and diversity, leading to a less stable bacterial community structure over time, whereas, more stable bacterial communities are provided by organic amendments. 16S rRNA gene-predicted functional structure was more affected by growth stage than by fertilizer treatment, although, some functions related to energy metabolism and metabolism of terpenoids and polyketides were enriched in samples not receiving any inorganic N, whereas inorganic N addition enriched predicted functions related to metabolism of other amino acids and carbohydrates. Understanding the impact of different fertilizers on the structure and dynamics of the rhizosphere microbiome is an important step toward developing strategies for production of crops in a sustainable way.},

abstract = {In this study, fresh dairy manure and bagasse pith were used as raw materials to study the effect of potassium persulfate in the aerobic composting process. The influence of sulfate radical anion (SO4−{\textperiodcentered}) generated by thermally activated persulfate on physicochemical parameters, lignocellulose degradation, humic substance (HS) formation, microbial community succession, and carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) composition were assessed during composting. Experimental results showed that the degradation rates of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin in the treatment group with potassium persulfate (PS) (61.47%, 74.63%, 73.1%) were higher than that in blank control group (CK) (59.98%, 71.47%, 70.89%), respectively. Additionally, persulfate additive promoted dynamic variation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and accelerated the formation of HS. Furthermore, metagenomics analysis revealed that persulfate changed the structure of the microbial community, and the relative abundances of Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria increased by 17.64% and 34.09% in PS, whereas 12.09% and 29.96% in CK. Glycoside hydrolases (GHs) and auxiliary activities (AAs) families were crucial to degrade lignocellulose, and their abundances were more in PS. Redundancy analysis (RDA) manifested that Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria were closely associated with lignocellulosic degradation. In brief, persulfate could accelerate the degradation of organic components, promote the formation of HS, optimize the structure of microbial community, and improve the compost quality.},

abstract = {Body size is a key life-history trait that influences community assembly by affecting how ecological processes operate at the organism level. However, the extent to which the relative influences of ecological processes mediate the assembly of differentially sized soil organisms is still unknown. Here, we investigate the community assembly of differentially sized soil microorganisms and microfauna using a continental-scale sampling effort combined with a global-scale meta-analysis. Our results reveal a general relationship between organism body size and the stochastic-deterministic balance operating on community assembly. The smallest microorganisms (bacteria) are relatively more influenced by dispersal-based stochastic processes, while larger ones (fungi, protists and nematodes) are more structured by selection-based deterministic processes. This study elucidates a significant and consistent relationship between an organism life-history trait and how distinct ecological processes operate in mediating their respective community assemblages, thus providing a better understanding of the mechanisms supporting soil biodiversity.},

abstract = {Rhizobia–legume symbiosis is an important type of plant–microbe mutualism; however, the establishment of this association is complicated and can be affected by many factors. The soybean rhizosphere has a specific microbial community, yet whether these organisms affect rhizobial nodulation has not been well investigated. Here, we analyzed the compositions and relationships of soybean rhizocompartment microbiota in three types of soil. First, we found that the rhizosphere community composition of soybean varied significantly in different soils, and the association network between rhizobia and other rhizosphere bacteria was examined. Second, we found that some rhizosphere microbes were correlated with the composition of bradyrhizobia and sinorhizobia in nodules. We cultivated 278 candidate Bacillus isolates from alkaline soil. Finally, interaction and nodulation assays showed that the Bacillus cereus group specifically promotes and suppresses the growth of sinorhizobia and bradyrhizobia, respectively, and alleviates the effects of saline–alkali conditions on the nodulation of sinorhizobia as well as affecting its colonization in nodules. Our findings demonstrate a crucial role of the bacterial microbiota in shaping rhizobia–host interactions in soybean, and provide a framework for improving the symbiotic efficiency of this system of mutualism through the use of synthetic bacterial communities.},

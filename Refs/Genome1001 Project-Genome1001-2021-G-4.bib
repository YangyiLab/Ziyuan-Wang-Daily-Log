abstract = {The role of non-duplex DNA, the guanine-quadruplex structure in particular, is becoming widely appreciated. Increasing evidence in the last decade implicates quadruplexes in important processes such as transcription and replication. Interestingly, more recent work suggests roles for quadruplexes, in association with quadruplex-interacting proteins, in epigenetics through both DNA and histone modifications. Here, we review the effect of the quadruplex structure on post-replication epigenetic memory and quadruplex-induced promoter DNA/histone modifications. Furthermore, we highlight the epigenetic state of the telomerase promoter where quadruplexes could play a key regulatory role. Finally, we discuss the possibility that DNA structures such as quadruplexes, within a largely duplex DNA background, could act as molecular anchors for locally induced epigenetic modifications.},

abstract = {Background: Transposable elements form a significant proportion of eukaryotic genomes. Recently, Lexa et al. (Nucleic Acids Res 42:968-978, 2014) reported that plant long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons often contain potential quadruplex sequences (PQSs) in their LTRs and experimentally confirmed their ability to adopt four-stranded DNA conformations. Results: Here, we searched for PQSs in human retrotransposons and found that PQSs are specifically localized in the 3'-UTR of LINE-1 elements, in LTRs of HERV elements and are strongly accumulated in specific regions of SVA elements. Circular dichroism spectroscopy confirmed that most PQSs had adopted monomolecular or bimolecular guanine quadruplex structures. Evolutionarily young SVA elements contained more PQSs than older elements and their propensity to form quadruplex DNA was higher. Full-length L1 elements contained more PQSs than truncated elements; the highest proportion of PQSs was found inside transpositionally active L1 elements (PA2 and HS families). Conclusions: Conservation of quadruplexes at specific positions of transposable elements implies their importance in their life cycle. The increasing quadruplex presence in evolutionarily young LINE-1 and SVA families makes these elements important contributors toward present genome-wide quadruplex distribution.},

abstract = {N6-Methyladenine (N6-mA or 6 mA) is an epigenetic DNA modification in eukaryotic genomes. In contrast to the well-established roles of 5-methylcytosine for epigenetic regulation of gene expression, the functional roles of N6-mA remain elusive. In particular, the impact of N6-mA modification of the DNA template on RNA polymerase II (pol II) transcription elongation is not known. In this work, using the Saccharomyces cerevisiae pol II transcriptional elongation system as a model, we investigated the molecular mechanism of pol II recognition and processing of N6-mA sites via both biochemical and structural approaches. We found that N6-mA causes site-specific pol II pausing/stalling. Structural analysis revealed that while N6-mA can reach the +1 template position, the stability of the N6-mA and UTP base pairing is compromised. Taken together, we reveal that the presence of the 6-methyl group on adenine reduces incorporation efficiency and promotes backtracking translocation. Our studies with yeast pol II provide molecular insights into understanding the impacts of N6-mA on pol II transcription dynamics in different organisms.},

abstract = {G-quadruplexes are nucleic acid secondary structures that form within guanine-rich DNA or RNA sequences. G-quadruplex formation can affect chromatin architecture and gene regulation and has been associated with genomic instability, genetic diseases and cancer progression. G-quadruplex formation in a DNA template can be assessed using polymerase stop assays, which measure polymerase stalling at G-quadruplex sites. An experimental technique, called G4-seq, was developed by combining features of the polymerase stop assay with Illumina next-generation sequencing. The experimental data produced by this technique provides unprecedented details on where and at what intensity do G-quadruplexes form in the human genome. Still, running the experimental protocol on a whole genome is an expensive and time-consuming process. Thus, it is highly desirable to have a computational method to predict G-quadruplex formation of new DNA sequences or whole genomes. Here, we present a new method, called G4detector, to predict G-quadruplexes from DNA sequences based on multi-kernel convolutional neural networks. To test G4detector, we compiled novel high-throughput in vitro and in vivo benchmarks. On these data, we show that G4detector outperforms extant methods for the same task on all benchmark datasets. We visualize the most important features of G4detector models and discover that G-quadruplex formation is highly depended on G-tracts length, their spacing and nucleotide composition between them. The code and benchmarks are publicly available on github.com/OrensteinLab/G4detector.},

abstract = {G-quadruplexes (G4s) are four-stranded nucleic acid structures with closely spaced guanine bases forming square planar G-quartets. Aberrant formation of G4 structures has been associated with genomic instability. However, most plant species are lacking comprehensive studies of G4 motifs. In this study, genome-wide identification of G4 motifs in barley was performed, followed by a comparison of genomic distribution and molecular functions to other monocot species, such as wheat, maize, and rice. Similar to the reports on human and some plants like wheat, G4 motifs peaked around the 5′ untranslated region (5′ UTR), the first coding domain sequence, and the first intron start sites on antisense strands. Our comparative analyses in human, Arabidopsis, maize, rice, and sorghum demonstrated that the peak points could be erroneously merged into a single peak when large window sizes are used. We also showed that the G4 distributions around genic regions are relatively similar in the species studied, except in the case of Arabidopsis. G4 containing genes in monocots showed conserved molecular functions for transcription initiation and hydrolase activity. Additionally, we provided examples of imperfect G4 motifs.},

abstract = {The G-quadruplex is a non-canonical DNA structure biologically significant in DNA replication, transcription and telomere stability. To date, only G4s with all guanines originating from the same strand of DNA have been considered in the context of the human nuclear genome. Here, I discuss interstrand topological configurations of G-quadruplex DNA, consisting of guanines from both strands of genomic DNA; an algorithm is presented for predicting such structures. I have identified over 550,000 non-overlapping interstrand Gquadruplex forming sequences in the human genome - significantly more than intrastrand configurations. Functional analysis of interstrand G-quadruplex sites shows strong association with transcription initiation, the results are consistent with the XPB and XPD transcriptional helicases binding only to G-quadruplex DNA with interstrand topology. Interstrand quadruplexes are also enriched in origin of replication sites. Several topology classes of interstrand quadruplex-forming sequences are possible, and different topologies are enriched in different types of structural elements. The list of interstrand quadruplex forming sequences, and the computer program used for their prediction are available at the web address http://moment.utmb.edu/allquads.},

@article{Guiblet2021a,
abstract = {Approximately 1% of the human genome has the ability to fold into G-quadruplexes (G4s)—noncanonical strand-specific DNA structures forming at G-rich motifs. G4s regulate several key cellular processes (e.g., transcription) and have been hypothesized to participate in others (e.g., firing of replication origins). Moreover, G4s differ in their thermostability, and this may affect their function. Yet, G4s may also hinder replication, transcription, and translation and may increase genome instability and mutation rates. Therefore, depending on their genomic location, thermostability, and functionality, G4 loci might evolve under different selective pressures, which has never been investigated. Here we conducted the first genome-wide analysis of G4 distribution, thermostability, and selection. We found an overrepresentation, high thermostability, and purifying selection for G4s within genic components in which they are expected to be functional—promoters, CpG islands, and 5′ and 3′ UTRs. A similar pattern was observed for G4s within replication origins, enhancers, eQTLs, and TAD boundary regions, strongly suggesting their functionality. In contrast, G4s on the nontranscribed strand of exons were underrepresented, were unstable, and evolved neutrally. In general, G4s on the nontranscribed strand of genic components had lower density and were less stable than those on the transcribed strand, suggesting that the former are avoided at the RNA level. Across the genome, purifying selection was stronger at stable G4s. Our results suggest that purifying selection preserves the sequences of functional G4s, whereas nonfunctional G4s are too costly to be tolerated in the genome. Thus, G4s are emerging as fundamental, functional genomic elements.},

abstract = {G-quadruplexes (G4s) are four-stranded DNA structures comprising stacks of four guanines, are prevalent in genomes, and have diverse biological functions in various chromosomal structures. A conserved protein, Rap1-interacting factor 1 (Rif1) from fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe), binds to Rif1-binding sequence (Rif1BS) and regulates DNA replication timing. Rif1BS is characterized by the presence of multiple G-tracts, often on both strands, and their unusual spacing. Although previous studies have suggested generation of G4-like structures on duplex Rif1BS, its precise molecular architecture remains unknown. Using gel-shift DNA binding assays and DNA foot-printing with various nuclease probes, we show here that both of the Rif1BS strands adopt specific higher-order structures upon heat denaturation. We observed that the structure generated on the G-strand is consistent with a G4 having unusually long loop segments and that the structure on the complementary C-strand does not have an intercalated motif (i-motif). Instead, we found that the formation of the C-strand structure depends on the G4 formation on the G-strand. Thus, the higher-order structure generated at Rif1BS involved both DNA strands, and in some cases, G4s may form on both of these strands. The presence of multiple G-tracts permitted the formation of alternative structures when some G-tracts were mutated or disrupted by deazaguanine replacement, indicating the robust nature of DNA higher-order structures generated at Rif1BS. Our results provide general insights into DNA structures generated at G4-forming sequences on duplex DNA.},

Short, double-stranded DNA sequence motifs are routinely implicated in TF recruitment, but many questions remain on how binding site specificity is governed. Results: Herein, we reveal a previously unappreciated role for DNA secondary structures as key features for TF recruitment. In a systematic, genome-wide study, we discover that endogenous G-quadruplex secondary structures (G4s) are prevalent TF binding sites in human chromatin. Certain TFs bind G4s with affinities comparable to double-stranded DNA targets. We demonstrate that, in a chromatin context, this binding interaction is competed out with a small molecule. Notably, endogenous G4s are prominent binding sites for a large number of TFs, particularly at promoters of highly expressed genes. Conclusions: Our results reveal a novel non-canonical mechanism for TF binding whereby G4s operate as common binding hubs for many different TFs to promote increased transcription.},

abstract = {<p>Guanine-rich nucleic acids can fold into the non-B DNA or RNA structures called G-quadruplexes (G4). Recent methodological developments have allowed the characterization of specific G-quadruplex structures in vitro as well as in vivo, and at a much higher throughput, in silico, which has greatly expanded our understanding of G4-associated functions. Typically, the consensus motif G3+N1–7G3+N1–7G3+N1–7G3+ has been used to identify potential G-quadruplexes from primary sequence. Since, various algorithms have been developed to predict the potential formation of quadruplexes directly from DNA or RNA sequences and the number of studies reporting genome-wide G4 exploration across species has rapidly increased. More recently, new methodologies have also appeared, proposing other estimates which consider non-canonical sequences and/or structure propensity and stability. The present review aims at providing an updated overview of the current open-source G-quadruplex prediction algorithms and straightforward examples of their implementation.</p>},

In addition to CpG methylation, the G-quadruplex (G4) structure has been reported as a regulator of gene expression. The identification of G4 forming sequences in CpG islands suggests an involvement of CpG-methylated G4 structures in biological processes; however, few reports have addressed the effects of CpG methylation on G4 structure. Methods: The thermostability of a methylated, 21-mer G4 structure located on the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene promoter containing four CpG sites (C1, C6, C11, and C17) were investigated using circular dichroism (CD) spectral analysis. Results: CD melting analysis revealed that VEGF G4 was stabilized by a single CpG methylation on C11 in the presence of Na + and Mg 2+ . However, either C1 or C11 methylation enhanced VEGF G4 thermal stability in the presence of K + . Conclusions: Single CpG methylation appears to enhance VEGF G4 thermostability in a manner dependent on both the CpG methylation site and cation type. General significance: These results are expected to contribute to the elucidation of the roles of CpG methylation-stabilized G4 structures in biological processes.},

We show that the presence of G4 structure is tightly associated with CGI hypomethylation in the human genome. Surprisingly, we find that these G4 sites are enriched for DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) occupancy, which is consistent with our biophysical observations that DNMT1 exhibits higher binding affinity for G4s as compared to duplex, hemi-methylated, or single-stranded DNA. The biochemical assays also show that the G4 structure itself, rather than sequence, inhibits DNMT1 enzymatic activity. Based on these data, we propose that G4 formation sequesters DNMT1 thereby protecting certain CGIs from methylation and inhibiting local methylation.},

In this study, we identified different types of G-quadruplex forming sequences (GQSes) in 15 sequenced plants and analyzed their distribution in various genomic features, including gene body, coding, intergenic and promoter regions. G2-type GQSes were most abundant in all the plant species analyzed. A strong association of G3-type GQSes with intergenic, promoter and intronic regions was found. However, G2-type GQSes were enriched in genic, CDS, exonic and untranslated regions. Further, we identified GQSes present in the conserved genes among monocots and dicots. The genes involved in development, cell growth and size, transmembrane transporter, and regulation of gene expression were found to be significantly enriched. In the promoter region, we detected strong co-occurrence of Telobox, ERF, MYB, RAV1B and E2F motifs with GQSes. Further, we validated the structure formation of several plant GQSes, demonstrated their effect on stalling in-vitro replication and revealed their interaction with plant nuclear proteins. Our data provide insights into the prevalence of GQSes in plants, establish their association with different genomic features and functional relevance.},

Besides the >1.5 million putative G-4–forming sequences (PQSs), the human genome features >640 million single-nucleotide variations (SNVs), the most common type of genetic variation among people or populations. An SNV may alter a G4 structure when it falls within a PQS motif. To date, genome-wide PQS–SNV interactions and their impact have not been investigated. Herein, we present a study on the PQS–SNV interactions and the impact they can bring to G4 structures and, subsequently, gene expressions. Based on build 154 of the Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Database (dbSNP), we identified 5 million gains/losses or structural conversions of G4s that can be caused by the SNVs. Of these G4 variations (G4Vs), 3.4 million are within genes, resulting in an average load of >120 G4Vs per gene, preferentially enriched near the transcription start site. Moreover, >80% of the G4Vs overlap with transcription factor–binding sites and >14% with enhancers, giving an average load of 3 and 7.5 for the two regulatory elements, respectively. Our experiments show that such G4Vs can significantly influence the expression of their host genes. These results reveal genome-wide G4Vs and their impact on gene activity, emphasizing an understanding of genetic variation, from a structural perspective, of their physiological function and pathological implications. The G4Vs may also provide a unique category of drug targets for individualized therapeutics, health risk assessment, and drug development.},

abstract = {G-quadruplex (GQ) is a four-stranded DNA structure that can be formed in guanine-rich sequences. GQ structures have been proposed to regulate diverse biological processes including transcription, replication, translation and telomere maintenance. Recent studies have demonstrated the existence of GQ DNA in live mammalian cells and a significant number of potential GQ forming sequences in the human genome. We present a systematic and quantitative analysis of GQ folding propensity on a large set of 438 GQ forming sequences in double-stranded DNA by integrating fluorescence measurement, single-molecule imaging and computational modeling. We find that short minimum loop length and the thymine base are two main factors that lead to high GQ folding propensity. Linear and Gaussian process regression models further validate that the GQ folding potential can be predicted with high accuracy based on the loop length distribution and the nucleotide content of the loop sequences. Our study provides important new parameters that can inform the evaluation and classification of putative GQ sequences in the human genome.},

abstract = {The G-quadruplex (G4) elements comprise a class of nucleic acid structures formed by stacking of guanine base quartets in a quadruple helix. This G4 DNA can form within or across single-stranded DNA molecules and is mutually exclusive with duplex B-form DNA. The reversibility and structural diversity of G4s make them highly versatile genetic structures, as demonstrated by their roles in various functions including telomere metabolism, genome maintenance, immunoglobulin gene diversification, transcription, and translation. Sequence motifs capable of forming G4 DNA are typically located in telomere repeat DNA and other non-telomeric genomic loci. To investigate their potential roles in a large-genome model plant species, we computationally identified 149,988 non-telomeric G4 motifs in maize (Zea mays L., B73 AGPv2), 29% of which were in non-repetitive genomic regions. G4 motif hotspots exhibited non-random enrichment in genes at two locations on the antisense strand, one in the 5' UTR and the other at the 5' end of the first intron. Several genic G4 motifs were shown to adopt sequence-specific and potassium-dependent G4 DNA structures invitro. The G4 motifs were prevalent in key regulatory genes associated with hypoxia (group VII ERFs), oxidative stress (DJ-1/GATase1), and energy status (AMPK/SnRK) pathways. They also showed statistical enrichment for genes in metabolic pathways that function in glycolysis, sugar degradation, inositol metabolism, and base excision repair. Collectively, the maize G4 motifs may represent conditional regulatory elements that can aid in energy status gene responses. Such a network of elements could provide a mechanistic basis for linking energy status signals to gene regulation in maize, a model genetic system and major world crop species for feed, food, and fuel.},

The methylation destabilizes the duplex structure when the adenine forms aWatson-Crick base pair, whereas the methylation on a terminal unpaired adenine stabilizes the duplex structure by increasing the stacking interaction. In this study, the effects of m6dA modification on the thermal stability of four distinct telomeric G-quadruplex (G4) structures were investigated. The m6dA-modified telomeric oligonucleotide d[AGGG(TTAGGG)3] that forms a basket-type G4 in Na+, d[(TTAGGG)4TT] that forms a hybrid-type G4 in K+ (Form-2), d[AAAGGG(TTAGGG)3AA] that forms a hybrid-type G4 in K+ (Form-1), and d[GGG(TTAGGG)3T] that forms a basket-type G4 with two G-tetrads in K+ (Form-3) were analyzed. Circular dichroism melting analysis demonstrated that (1) A7- and A19-methylation destabilized the basket-type G4 structure that formed in Na+, whereas A13-methylation stabilized the structure; (2) A15-methylation stabilized the Form-2 G4 structure; (3) A15- and A21-methylations stabilized the Form-1 G4 structure; and (4) A12-methylation stabilized the Form-3 G4 structure. These results suggest that m6dA modifications may affect the thermal stability of human telomeric G4 structures in regulating the biological functions.},

abstract = {A challenge in medical genomics is to identify variants and genes associated with severe genetic disorders. Based on the premise that severe, early-onset disorders often result in a reduction of evolutionary fitness, several statistical methods have been developed to predict pathogenic variants or constrained genes based on the signatures of negative selection in human populations. However, we currently lack a statistical framework to jointly predict deleterious variants and constrained genes from both variant-level features and gene-level selective constraints. Here we present such a unified approach, UNEECON, based on deep learning and population genetics. UNEECON treats the contributions of variant-level features and gene-level constraints as a variant-level fixed effect and a gene-level random effect, respectively. The sum of the fixed and random effects is then combined with an evolutionary model to infer the strength of negative selection at both variant and gene levels. Compared with previously published methods, UNEECON shows improved performance in predicting missense variants and protein-coding genes associated with autosomal dominant disorders, and feature importance analysis suggests that both gene-level selective constraints and variant-level predictors are important for accurate variant prioritization. Furthermore, based on UNEECON, we observe a low correlation between gene-level intolerance to missense mutations and that to loss-of-function mutations, which can be partially explained by the prevalence of disordered protein regions that are highly tolerant to missense mutations. Finally, we show that genes intolerant to both missense and loss-of-function mutations play key roles in the central nervous system and the autism spectrum disorders. Overall, UNEECON is a promising framework for both variant and gene prioritization.},

Structurally, they have many configurations and can form from one or more DNA strands. At the gene level, they regulate gene expression and protein synthesis. In this paper, chromosomal-level patterns of distribution are analyzed on the human genome to identify high-level distribution patterns potentially related to global functional processes. Here we show unique high density banding patterns on individual chromosomes that are highly correlated, appearing in a mirror pattern, across forward and reverse DNA strands. The highest density of G4 sequences occurs within four megabases of one end of most chromosomes and contains G4 motifs that bind with zinc finger proteins. These findings suggest that G4 may play a role in global chromosomal processes such as those found in meiosis. Copyright:},

However, there is little information on the evolutionary history and distribution characteristics of G4s. Here, whole-genome characteristics of potential G4s were studied in 37 evolutionarily representative species. During evolution, the number, length, and density of G4s generally increased. Immunofluorescence in seven species confirmed G4s' presence and evolutionary pattern. G4s tended to cluster in chromosomes and were enriched in genetic regions. Short-loop G4s were conserved in most species, while loop-length diversity also existed, especially in mammals. The proportion of G4-bearing genes and orthologue genes, which appeared to be increasingly enriched in transcription factors, gradually increased. The antagonistic relationship between G4s and DNA methylation sites was detected. These findings imply that organisms may have evolutionarily developed G4 into a novel reversible and elaborate transcriptional regulatory mechanism benefiting multiple physiological activities of higher organisms.},

abstract = {Arabidopsis thaliana transcriptomes have been extensively studied and characterized under different conditions. However, most of the current 'RNA-sequencing' technologies produce a relatively short read length and demand a reverse-transcription step, preventing effective characterization of transcriptome complexity. Here, we performed Direct RNA Sequencing (DRS) using the latest Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) with exceptional read length. We demonstrate that the complexity of the A. thaliana transcriptomes has been substantially under-estimated. The ONT direct RNA sequencing identified novel transcript isoforms at both the vegetative (14-day old seedlings, stage 1.04) and reproductive stages (stage 6.00-6.10) of development. Using in-house software called TrackCluster, we determined alternative transcription initiation (ATI), alternative polyadenylation (APA), alternative splicing (AS), and fusion transcripts. More than 38 500 novel transcript isoforms were identified, including six categories of fusion-transcripts that may result from differential RNA processing mechanisms. Aided by the Tombo algorithm, we found an enrichment of m5C modifications in the mobile mRNAs, consistent with a recent finding that m5C modification in mRNAs is crucial for their long-distance movement. In summary, ONT DRS offers an advantage in the identification and functional characterization of novel RNA isoforms and RNA base modifications, significantly improving annotation of the A. thaliana genome.},

Here, we have discovered that SP1 binds also to a non-canonical DNA structure, a G-quadruplex, with high affinity. In particular, we have studied the SP1 binding site within the promoter region of the c-KIT oncogene and found that this site can fold into an anti-parallel two-tetrad G-quadruplex. SP1 pull-down experiments from cellular extracts, together with biophysical binding assays revealed that SP1 has a comparable binding affinity for this G-quadruplex structure and the canonical SP1 duplex sequence. Using SP1 ChIP-on-chip data sets, we have also found that 87 of SP1 binding sites overlap with G-quadruplex forming sequences. Furthermore, while many of these immuoprecipitated sequences (36) even lack the minimal SP1 consensus motif, 5′-GGGCGG-3′, we have shown that 77 of them are putative G-quadruplexes. Collectively, these data suggest that SP1 is able to bind both, canonical SP1 duplex DNA as well as G-quadruplex structures in vitro and we hypothesize that both types of interactions may occur in cells. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Author(s).},

They have gag and pol genes and several regulatory regions necessary for transcription and reverse transcription. We searched for potential quadruplex-forming sequences (PQSs) and potential triplex-forming sequences (PTSs) in 18 377 full-length LTR retrotransposons collected from 21 plant species. We found that PQSs were often located in LTRs, both upstream and downstream of promoters from which the whole retrotransposon is transcribed. Upstream-located guanine PQSs were dominant in the minus DNA strand, whereas downstreamlocated guanine PQSs prevailed in the plus strand, indicating their role both at transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. Our circular dichroism spectroscopy measurements confirmed that these PQSs readily adopted guanine quadruplex structures-some of them were paralell-stranded, while others were anti-parallel-stranded. The PQS often formed doublets at a mutual distance of up to 400 bp. PTSs were most abundant in 30UTR (but were also present in 50UTR). We discuss the potential role of quadruplexes and triplexes as the regulators of various processes participating in LTR retrotransposon life cycle and as potential recombination sites during post-insertional retrotransposonbased genome rearrangements. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Author(s).},

abstract = {The DNA methyltransferase enzymes (DNMTs) catalyzing cytosine methylation do so at specific locations of the genome, although with some level of redundancy. The de novo methyltransferases DNMT3A and 3B play a vital role in methylating the genome of the developing embryo in regions devoid of methylation marks. The ability of DNMTs to colocalize at sites of DNA damage is suggestive that recognition of mispaired bases and unusual structures is inherent to the function of these proteins. We provide evidence for G-quadruplex formation within imprinted gene promoters, and report high-affinity binding of recombinant human DNMTs to such DNA G-quadruplexes in vitro. These observations suggest a potential interaction of G-quadruplexes with the DNA methylation machinery, which may be of epigenetic and biological significance.},

abstract = {G quadruplexes (G4) are higher-order DNA and RNA secondary structures formed by G-rich sequences that are built around tetrads of hydrogen-bonded guanine bases. Potential G4 quadruplex sequences have been identified in G-rich eukaryotic non-telomeric and telomeric genomic regions. Upon function, G4 formation is known to involve in chromatin remodeling, gene regulation and has been associated with genomic instability, genetic diseases and cancer progression. The natural role and biological validation of G4 structures is starting to be explored, and is of particular interest for the therapeutic interventions for human diseases. However, the existence and physiological role of G4 DNA and G4 RNA in plants species have not been much investigated yet and therefore, is of great interest for the development of improved crop varieties for sustainable agriculture. In this context, several recent studies suggests that these highly diverse G4 structures in plants can be employed to regulate expression of genes involved in several pathophysiological conditions including stress response to biotic and abiotic stresses as well as DNA damage. In the current review, we summarize the recent findings regarding the emerging functional significance of G4 structures in plants and discuss their potential value in the development of improved crop varieties.},

abstract = {Promoters often contain asymmetric G- and C-rich strands, in which the cytosines are prone to epigenetic modification via methylation (5-mC) and 5-hydroxymethylation (5-hmC). These sequences can also form four-stranded G-quadruplex (G4) or i-motif (iM) secondary structures. Although the requisite sequences for epigenetic modulation and iM/G4 formation are similar and can overlap, they are unlikely to coexist. Despite 5-hmC being an oxidization product of 5-mC, the two modified bases cluster at distinct loci. This study focuses on the intersection of G4/iM formation and 5-hmC modification using the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene promoter's CpG sites and examines whether incorporation of 5-hmC into iM/G4 structures had any physicochemical effect on formation, stability, or recognition by nucleolin or the cationic porphyrin, TMPyP4. No marked changes were found in the formation or stability of iM and G4 structures; however, changes in recognition by nucleolin or TMPyP4 occurred with 5-hmC modification wherein protein and compound binding to 5-hmC modified G4s was notably reduced. G4/iM structures in the VEGF promoter are promising therapeutic targets for antiangiogenic therapy, and this work contributes to a comprehensive understanding of their governing principles related to potential transcriptional control and targeting.},

abstract = {Background: G-quadruplex is a DNA secondary structure that has been shown to play an important role in biological systems. In a previous study, we identified 1998 G-quadruplex-forming sequences using a mouse CpG islands DNA microarray with a fluorescent-labeled G-quadruplex ligand. Among these putative G-quadruplex-forming sequences, G-quadruplex formation was verified for 10 randomly selected sequences by CD spectroscopy and DMS footprinting analysis. In this study, the biological function of the 10 G-quadruplex-forming sequences in the transcriptional regulation has been analyzed using a reporter assay. Results: When G-quadruplex-forming sequences from the Dele and Cdc6 genes have been cloned in reporter vectors carrying a minimal promoter and the luciferase gene, luciferase expression is activated. This has also been detected in experiments applying a promoterless reporter vector. Mutational analysis reveals that guanine bases, which form the G-tetrads, are important in the activation. In addition, the activation has been found to decrease by the telomestatin derivative L1H1-7OTD which can bind to the G-quadruplex DNA. When Dele and Cdc6 CpG islands, containing the G-quadruplex-forming sequence, have been cloned in the promoterless reporter vector, the luciferase expression is activated. Mutational analysis reveals that the expression level is decreased by mutation on Dele G-quadruplex; however, increased by mutation on Cdc6 G-quadruplex. Conclusion:Dele and Cdc6 G-quadruplex formation is significant in the transcriptional regulation. Dele and Cdc6 G-quadruplex DNA alone possess enhancer and promotor function. When studied in more complex CpG islands Dele G-quadruplex also demonstrates promotor activity, whereas Cdc6 G-quadruplex may possess a dual function of transcriptional regulation.},

abstract = {The C-5-methylation of cytosine in the CpG islands is an important pattern for epigenetic modification of gene, which plays a key role in regulating gene transcription. G-quadruplex is an unusual DNA secondary structure formed in G-rich regions and is identified as a transcription repressor in some oncogenes, such as c-myc and bcl-2. In the present study, the results from CD spectrum and FRET assay showed that the methylation of cytosine in the CpG islands could induce a conformational change of the G-quadruplex in the P1 promoter of bcl-2, and greatly increase the thermal-stability of this DNA oligomer. Moreover, the methylation of cytosine in the G-quadruplex could protect the structure from the disruption by the complementary strand, showing with the increasing ability to arrest the polymerase in PCR stop assay. This data indicated that the stabilization of the G-quadruplex structure in the CpG islands might be involved in the epigenetical transcriptional regulation for specific genes through the C-5-methylation modification pattern. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {G-quadruplex (G4) is a DNA/RNA conformation that consists of two or more G-tetrads resulting from four-guanine bases connected by Hoogsteen-type hydrogen bonds, which is often found in the telomeres of chromatin, as well as in the promoter regions of genes. The function of G4 in the genomic DNA is being elucidated and some G4-protein interactions have been reported; these are believed to play a role in vital cellular functions. In this study, we focused on CpG methylation, a well-known epigenetic modification of the genomic DNA, especially found in the promoter regions. Although many G4-forming sequences within the genomic DNA harbor CpG sites, the relationship between CpG methylation and the binding properties of associated proteins remains unclear. We demonstrated that the binding ability of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) G4 DNA to VEGF165 protein was significantly decreased by CpG methylation. We identified the binding activity of G4 DNA oligonucleotides derived from gene promoter regions to SP1, a transcription factor that interacts with a G4-forming DNA and is also altered by CpG methylation. The effect of methylation on binding affinity was accompanied by changes in G4 structure and/or topology. Therefore, this study suggested that CpG methylation might be involved in protein binding to G4-forming DNA segments for purposes of transcriptional regulation.},

abstract = {Background: Genome-wide methylation of cytosine can be modulated in the presence of TET and thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) enzymes. TET is able to oxidise 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), 5-formylcytosine (5fC) and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC). TDG can excise the oxidative products 5fC and 5caC, initiating base excision repair. These modified bases are stable and detectable in the genome, suggesting that they could have epigenetic functions in their own right. However, functional investigation of the genome-wide distribution of 5fC has been restricted to cell culture-based systems, while its in vivo profile remains unknown. Results: Here, we describe the first analysis of the in vivo genome-wide profile of 5fC across a range of tissues from both wild-type and Tdg-deficient E11.5 mouse embryos. Changes in the formylation profile of cytosine upon depletion of TDG suggest TET/TDG-mediated active demethylation occurs preferentially at intron-exon boundaries and reveals a major role for TDG in shaping 5fC distribution at CpG islands. Moreover, we find that active enhancer regions specifically exhibit high levels of 5fC, resulting in characteristic tissue-diagnostic patterns, which suggest a role in embryonic development. Conclusions: The tissue-specific distribution of 5fC can be regulated by the collective contribution of TET-mediated oxidation and excision by TDG. The in vivo profile of 5fC during embryonic development resembles that of embryonic stem cells, sharing key features including enrichment of 5fC in enhancer and intragenic regions. Additionally, by investigating mouse embryo 5fC profiles in a tissue-specific manner, we identify targeted enrichment at active enhancers involved in tissue development.},

Reporter assays demonstrated that individual regions did not show enhancer activity; however, the deletion of the (GGA)14 region resulted in 1.5-fold higher enhancer activity than that of the whole enhancer.

abstract = {DNA sequences capable of forming G-quadruplex (G4) structures can be predicted and mapped in plant genomes using computerized pattern search programs. Non-telomeric G4 motifs have recently been found to number in the thousands across many plant species and enriched around gene promoters, prompting speculation that they may represent a newly uncovered and ubiquitous family of cis-acting elements. Comparative analysis shows that monocots exhibit five to ten times higher G4 motif density than eudicots, but the significance of this difference has not been determined. The vast scale and complexity of G4 functions, actual or theoretical, are reviewed in relation to the multiple modes of action and myriad genetic functions for which G4s have been implicated in DNA and RNA. Future experimental strategies and opportunities include identifying plant G4-interactomes, resolving the structures of G4s with and without their binding partners, and defining molecular mechanisms through reporter gene, genetic, or genome editing approaches. Given the global importance of plants for food, clothing, medicine, and energy, together with the potential role of G4 motifs as a widely conserved set of DNA sequences that could coordinate gene regulation, future plant G4 research holds great potential for use in plant improvement strategies.},

abstract = {DNA secondary structures and methylation are two wellknown mechanisms that regulate gene expression. The catalytic subunit of telomerase, human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), is overexpressed in -90% of human cancers to maintain telomere length for cell immortalization. Binding of CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) to the first exon of the hTERT gene can down-regulate its expression. However, DNA methylation in the first exon can prevent CTCF binding in most cancers, but the molecular mechanism is unknown. TheNMRanalysis showed that a stretch of guanine-rich sequence in the first exon of hTERT and located within the CTCF-binding region can form two secondary structures, a hairpin and a quadruplex. A key finding was that the methylation of cytosine at the specific CpGdinucleotides will participate in quartet formation, causing the shift of the equilibrium from the hairpin structure to the quadruplex structure. Of further importance was the finding that the quadruplex formation disrupts CTCF protein binding, which results in an increase in hTERT gene expression. Our results not only identify quadruplex formation in the first exon promoted by CpG dinucleotide methylation as a regulator of hTERT expression but also provide a possible mechanistic insight into the regulation of gene expression via secondary DNA structures.},

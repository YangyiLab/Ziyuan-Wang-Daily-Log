abstract = {ABSTRACT: Photosynthetically derived rhizodeposits are an important source of carbon (C) for microbes in root vicinity and can influence the microbial community dynamics. Pulse labeling of carbon dioxide (13CO2) coupled with stable isotope probing techniques have potential to track recently fixed photosynthate into rhizosphere microbial taxa. Therefore, the present investigation assessed the microbial community change associated with the rhizosphere and bulk soil in Jatropha curcas L. (a biofuel crop) by combining phospholipid fatty acid (13C-PLFA) profiling using a stable isotope 13CO2 labeling approach. The labeling (13C) took place after 45 days of germination, PLFAs were extracted from both soils (rhizosphere and bulk) after 1 and 20 days pulse labeling and analyzed by gas chromatography-isotope ratio mass spectrometry. There was no significant temporal effect on the PLFA profiles in the bulk soil, but significantly increased abundance of Gram positive (i15:0) and Gram negative (16:1$\omega$7c and 16:1$\omega$5c) biomarkers was observed in the rhizosphere soil from day 1 to day 20 after labeling. The Gram negative (16:1$\omega$7c) decreased and fungal (18:2$\omega$6,9c) increased significantly in rhizospheric soil compared to bulk soil after day 1 of labeling. Whereas, after 20 days of labeling, the Gram negative biomarker (16:1$\omega$7c and 18:1$\omega$7c) decreased and Gram positive (a15:0) increased significantly in rhizospheric soil compared to bulk soil. One day following labeling, i15:0, a15:0, i16:0, 16:1$\omega$5c, 16:0, i17:0, a17:0, 18:2$\omega$6,9c, 18:1$\omega$9c, and 18:0 PLFAs were significantly more enriched in $\delta$13C in the rhizosphere than in the bulk soil. Twenty days after labeling, 16:1$\omega$5c (Gram negative) and 18:2$\omega$6,9c (fungal) were significantly more enriched in $\delta$13C in the rhizosphere than in the bulk soil. These results shows the effectives of PLFA coupled using the pulse chase labeling technique to examine the microbial community changes in response to recently fixed photosynthetic C flow in rhizodeposits.},

abstract = {Humans continue to transform the global nitrogen cycle at a record pace, reflecting an increased combustion of fossil fuels, growing demand for nitrogen in agriculture and industry, and pervasive inefficiencies in its use. Much anthropogenic nitrogen is lost to air, water, and land to cause a cascade of environmental and human health problems. Simultaneously, food production in some parts of the world is nitrogen-deficient, highlighting inequities in the distribution of nitrogen-containing fertilizers. Optimizing the need for a key human resource while minimizing its negative consequences requires an integrated interdisciplinary approach and the development of strategies to decrease nitrogen-containing waste.},

abstract = {Arid shrublands are stressful environments, typified by alkaline soils low in organic matter, with biologically-limiting extremes in water availability, temperature, and UV radiation. The widely-spaced plants and interspace biological soil crusts in these regions provide soil nutrients in a localized fashion, creating a mosaic pattern of plant- or crust-associated microhabitats with distinct nutrient composition. With sporadic and limited rainfall, nutrients are primarily retained in the shallow surface soil, patterning biological activity. We examined soil bacterial and fungal community responses to simulated nitrogen (N) deposition in an arid Larrea tridentata-Ambrosia dumosa field experiment in southern Nevada, USA, using high-throughput sequencing of ribosomal RNA genes. To examine potential interactions among the N application, microhabitat and soil depth, we sampled soils associated with shrub canopies and interspace biological crusts at two soil depths (0-0.5 or 0-10 cm) across the N-amendment gradient (0, 7, and 15 kg ha-1 yr-1). We hypothesized that localized compositional differences in soil microbiota would constrain the impacts of N addition to a microhabitat distribution that would reflect highly localized geochemical conditions and microbial community composition. The richness and community composition of both bacterial and fungal communities differed significantly by microhabitat and with soil depth in each microhabitat. Only bacterial communities exhibited significant responses to the N addition. Community composition correlated with microhabitat and depth differences in soil geochemical features. Given the distinct roles of soil bacteria and fungi in major nutrient cycles, the resilience of fungi and sensitivity of bacteria to N amendments suggests that increased N input predicted for many arid ecosystems could shift nutrient cycling toward pathways driven primarily by fungal communities.},

abstract = {Soil physicochemical properties, soil microbial biomass and bacterial community structures in a rice-wheat cropping system subjected to different fertilizer regimes were investigated in two seasons (June and October). All fertilizer regimes increased the soil microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen. Both fertilizer regime and time had a significant effect on soil physicochemical properties and bacterial community structure. The combined application of inorganic fertilizer and manure organic-inorganic fertilizer significantly enhanced the bacterial diversity in both seasons. The bacterial communities across all samples were dominated by Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria and Chloroflexi at the phylum level. Permutational multivariate analysis confirmed that both fertilizer treatment and season were significant factors in the variation of the composition of the bacterial community. Hierarchical cluster analysis based on Bray-Curtis distances further revealed that bacterial communities were separated primarily by season. The effect of fertilizer treatment is significant (P = 0.005) and accounts for 7.43% of the total variation in bacterial community. Soil nutrients (e.g., available K, total N, total P and organic matter) rather than pH showed significant correlation with the majority of abundant taxa. In conclusion, both fertilizer treatment and seasonal changes affect soil properties, microbial biomass and bacterial community structure. The application of NPK plus manure organic-inorganic fertilizer may be a sound fertilizer practice for sustainable food production. {\textcopyright} 2014 Zhao et al.},

abstract = {Nitrite-dependent anaerobic methane oxidation (n-damo) process uniquely links microbial nitrogen and carbon cycles. Research on n-damo bacteria progresses quickly with experimental evidences through enrichment cultures. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods for detecting them in various natural ecosystems and engineered systems play a very important role in the discovery of their distribution, abundance, and biodiversity in the ecosystems. Important characteristics of n-damo enrichments were obtained and their key significance in microbial nitrogen and carbon cycles was investigated. The molecular methods currently used in detecting n-damo bacteria were comprehensively reviewed and discussed for their strengths and limitations in applications with a wide range of samples. The pmoA gene-based PCR primers for n-damo bacterial detection were evaluated and, in particular, several incorrectly stated PCR primer nucleotide sequences in the published papers were also pointed out to allow correct applications of the PCR primers in current and future investigations. Furthermore, this review also offers the future perspectives of n-damo bacteria based on current information and methods available for a better acquisition of new knowledge about this group of bacteria.},

abstract = {Pyrosequencing-based analyses revealed significant effects among low (N50), medium (N80), and high (N100) fertilization on community composition involving a long-term monoculture of lettuce in a greenhouse in both summer and winter. The non-fertilized control (CK) treatment was characterized by a higher relative abundance of Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, and Chloroflexi; however, the average abundance of Firmicutes typically increased in summer, and the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes increased in winter in the N-fertilized treatments. Principle component analysis showed that the distribution of the microbial community was separated by a N gradient with N80 and N100 in the same group in the summer samples, while CK and N50 were in the same group in the winter samples, with the other N-level treatments existing independently. Redundancy analysis revealed that available N, NO3- -N, and NH4+ -N, were the main environmental factors affecting the distribution of the bacterial community. Correlation analysis showed that nitrogen affected the shifts of microbial communities by strongly driving the shifts of Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria in summer samples, and Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and Acidobacteria in winter samples. The study demonstrates a novel example of rhizosphere bacterial diversity and the main factors influencing rizosphere microbial community in continuous vegetable cropping within an intensive greenhouse ecosystem.},

The leafy vegetables are the major vehicle for the entry of nitrate into the human system. The present study was conducted to establish a flow injection analysis (FIA) technique to investigate the nitrate-N contents of four commonly consumed fresh leafy vegetables (Chinese cabbage, celery, lettuce and English cabbage) from market in Fiji. Two extraction techniques (activated carbon and alkaline extraction) were assessed to extract nitrate-N and the activated carbon extraction was preferred over alkaline extraction and applied. The recoveries of spiked nitrate-N in vegetable matrices ranged from 90.40% to 112.80% in activated carbon extraction with an average of 100.62%. The effects of cooking (boiling, baking and frying) and deep-freezing on the nitrate-N contents were also studied. Nitrate contents in selected leafy vegetables were determined by FIA coupled with Greiss protocol involving sulfanilamide and N-(1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine dihydrochloride as color reagents. Nitrate was determined in the linear range from 1.0 to 20.0 mg L-1 with the method detection limit of 0.042 mg L-1 (0.34 mg kg-1). The results of the study show that nitrate contents in fresh leafy vegetables ranged from 1297 to 5658 mg kg-1. Boiling reduces nitrate content by 47-56% whereas frying in Soya bean oil elevates nitrate content by as much as 159-307%. No significant change was observed in nitrate content after baking. The deep-freezing of the selected leafy vegetables shows that nitrate-N content fluctuates slightly from the original nitrate-N values over the seven day period. The FIA throughput was 38 samples h-1. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The successional ecology of nitrogen cycling in biocrusts and the linkages to ecosystem processes remains unclear. To explore this, four successional stages of natural biocrust with five batches of repeated sampling and three developmental stages of simulated biocrust were studied using relative and absolute quantified multi-omics methods. A consistent pattern across all biocrust was found where ammonium assimilation, mineralization, dissimilatory nitrite to ammonium (DNiRA), and assimilatory nitrate to ammonium were abundant, while denitrification medium, N-fixation, and ammonia oxidation were low. Mathematic analysis showed that the nitrogen cycle in natural biocrust was driven by dissolved organic N and NO3–. pH and SO42– were the strongest variables affecting denitrification, while C:(N:P) was the strongest variable affecting N-fixation, DNiRA, nitrite oxidation, and dissimilatory nitrate to nitrite. Furthermore, N-fixation and DNiRA were closely related to elemental stoichiometry and redox balance, while assimilatory nitrite to ammonium (ANiRA) and mineralization were related to hydrological cycles. Together with the absolute quantification and network models, our results suggest that responsive ANiRA and mineralization decreased during biocrust succession; whereas central respiratory DNiRA, the final step of denitrification, and the complexity and interaction of the whole nitrogen cycle network increased. Therefore, our study stresses the changing environmental functions in the biocrust N-cycle, which are succession-dependent.},

abstract = {The nitrogen (N) cycle is a collection of important biogeochemical pathways mediated by microbial communities and is an important constraint in response to elevated CO2 in many terrestrial ecosystems. Previous studies attempting to relate soil N cycling to microbial genetic data mainly focused on a few gene families by PCR, protein assays and functional gene arrays, leaving the taxonomic and functional composition of soil microorganisms involved in the whole N cycle less understood. In this study, 24 soil samples were collected from the long-term experimental site, BioCON, in 2009. A shotgun metagenome sequencing approach was employed to survey the microbial gene families involved in soil N cycle in the grassland that had been exposed to elevated CO2 (eCO2) for >12 years. In addition to evaluating the responses of major N cycling gene families to long-term eCO2, we also aimed to characterize the taxonomic and functional composition of these gene families involved in soil N transformations. At the taxonomic level, organic N metabolism and nitrate reduction had the most diverse microbial species involved. The distinct taxonomic composition of different N cycling processes suggested that the complex N cycle in natural ecosystems was a result of multiple processes by many different microorganisms. Belowground microbial communities that mediate N cycling responded to eCO2 in several different ways, including through stimulated abundances of the gene families related with organic decomposition, dissimilatory nitrate reduction, and N2 fixation, and suppressed abundances of the gene families in glutamine synthesis and anammox. This study provides a genetic basis of the microorganisms involved in key processes in the N cycle in complex ecosystems, and shows that long-term eCO2 selectively affects N cycling pathways instead of tuning up every process.},

abstract = {Despite being the world's third largest ocean, the Indian Ocean is one of the least studied and understood with respect to microbial diversity as well as biogeochemical and ecological functions. In this study, we investigated the microbial community and its metabolic potential for nitrogen (N) acquisition in the oligotrophic surface waters of the Indian Ocean using a metagenomic approach. Proteobacteria and Cyanobacteria dominated the microbial community with an average 37.85 and 23.56% of relative abundance, respectively, followed by Bacteroidetes (3.73%), Actinobacteria (1.69%), Firmicutes (0.76%), Verrucomicrobia (0.36%), and Planctomycetes (0.31%). Overall, only 24.3% of functional genes were common among all sampling stations indicating a high level of gene diversity. However, the presence of 82.6% common KEGG Orthology (KOs) in all samples showed high functional redundancy across the Indian Ocean. Temperature, phosphate, silicate and pH were important environmental factors regulating the microbial distribution in the Indian Ocean. The cyanobacterial genus Prochlorococcus was abundant with an average 17.4% of relative abundance in the surface waters, and while 54 Prochlorococcus genomes were detected, 53 were grouped mainly within HLII clade. In total, 179 of 234 Prochlorococcus sequences extracted from the global ocean dataset were clustered into HL clades and exhibited less divergence, but 55 sequences of LL clades presented more divergence exhibiting different branch length. The genes encoding enzymes related to ammonia metabolism, such as urease, glutamate dehydrogenase, ammonia transporter, and nitrilase presented higher abundances than the genes involved in inorganic N assimilation in both microbial community and metagenomic Prochlorococcus population. Furthermore, genes associated with dissimilatory nitrate reduction, denitrification, nitrogen fixation, nitrification and anammox were absent in metagenome Prochlorococcus population, i.e., nitrogenase and nitrate reductase. Notably, the de novo biosynthesis pathways of six different amino acids were incomplete in the metagenomic Prochlorococcus population and Prochlorococcus genomes, suggesting compensatory uptake of these amino acids from the environment. These results reveal the features of the taxonomic and functional structure of the Indian Ocean microbiome and their adaptive strategies to ambient N deficiency in the oligotrophic ocean.},

This soil microbiome profoundly alters plant growth and in turn depends on root secretion and is shaped by plant immunity. Summary: This article is about life underground. More specifically it is about the rhizosphere, the zone where plant roots meet the soil. The whole of terrestrial life depends on a few inches of soil. Soil is complicated. The nature of the soil is shaped by the presence of roots. In turn, the microbes in the soil immediately surrounding roots have a profound influence on plant growth and development. The soil microbiome is the community of soil microorganisms. Sampling and analyzing the soil microbiome and the way in which microbes and roots recognize and associate with each other are technically challenging.

Here we describe a new member of the bacterial flagellar stator channel family (MotAB1 of Paenibacillus sp. TCA20 (TCA-MotAB1)) that is coupled to divalent cations (Ca2+ and Mg2+). In the absence of divalent cations of alkaline earth metals, no swimming was observed in Paenibacillus sp. TCA20, which grows optimally in Ca2+ -rich environments. This pattern was confirmed by swimming assays of a stator-free Bacillus subtilis mutant expressing TCA-MotAB1. Both a stator-free and major Mg2+ uptake system-deleted B. subtilis mutant expressing TCA-MotAB1 complemented both growth and motility deficiency under low Mg2+ conditions and exhibited [Mg2+]in identical to that of the wild-type. This is the first report of a flagellar motor that can use Ca2+ and Mg2+ as coupling ions. These findings will promote the understanding of the operating principles of flagellar motors and molecular mechanisms of ion selectivity.},

abstract = {Motility allows many microbes to traverse their environment to find nutrient sources or escape unfavorable environments. However, some microbes are nonmotile and are restricted to their immediate conditions. Intriguingly, sporadic reports have demonstrated that many nonmotile microbes can utilize the motility machinery of other microbes in their vicinity. This form of transportation, called hitchhiking, has been observed with both prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbes. Importantly, many hitchhiking microbes are pathogenic to humans or plants. Here, we discuss reports of intermicrobial hitchhiking to generate a comprehensive view of hitchhiking mechanisms and how such interactions may influence human and plant health. We hypothesize that microbial hitchhiking is ubiquitous in nature and may become the subject of an independent subfield of research in microbiology.},

The biofilm growth cycle encompasses bacterial adhesion at all levels, starting with the initial physical attraction of bacteria to a substrate, and ending with the eventual liberation of cell clusters from the biofilm matrix. When describing bacterial adhesion one is simply describing one or more stages of biofilm development, neglecting the fact that the population may not reach maturity. This article provides an overview of bacterial adhesion, cites examples of how bacterial adhesion affects industry and summarises methods and instrumentation used to improve our understanding of the adhesive properties of bacteria.},

abstract = {Excessive ammonia (NH3) emitted from nitrogen fertilizer application in farmland have caused serious disturbance to global environment, including reduction of visibility, formation of regional haze, and increase of nitrogen deposition. Application of biofertilizer has been considered as an effective approach for soil improvement and agriculture sustainability. In this study, a field experiment was conducted to evaluate the potential of B. subtilis biofertilizer on mitigating NH3 volatilization and to investigate the underlying mechanisms. Compared with organic fertilizer, the incorporation of B. subtilis biofertilizer reduced NH3 volatilization by up to 44%. Moreover, the application of B. subtilis biofertilizer reduced the abundance of ureC gene, and increased the abundance of functional genes (bacterial amoA and comammox amoA) and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB). This indicated that the conversion of fertilizer nitrogen to NH4+-N was decreased and the nitrification process was increased. In brief, the application of B. subtilis biofertilizer reduced the “source” and increased the “sink” of NH4+-N, thus reducing the retention of NH4+-N in alkaline soil, and mitigating NH3 volatilization. These results indicated that B. subtilis biofertilizer is an effective control strategy for agricultural NH3 emission, maintaining high crop yield and mitigating environmental disturbance.},

abstract = {Our meta-analysis of 126 nitrogen addition experiments evaluated nitrogen (N) limitation of net primary production (NPP) in terrestrial ecosystems. We tested the hypothesis that N limitation is widespread among biomes and influenced by geography and climate. We used the response ratio (R ≅ ANPPN/ANPPctrl) of aboveground plant growth in fertilized to control plots and found that most ecosystems are nitrogen limited with an average 29% growth response to nitrogen (i.e., R = 1.29). The response ratio was significant within temperate forests (R = 1.19), tropical forests (R = 1.60), temperate grasslands (R = 1.53), tropical grasslands (R = 1.26), wetlands (R = 1.16), and tundra (R = 1.35), but not deserts. Eight tropical forest studies had been conducted on very young volcanic soils in Hawaii, and this subgroup was strongly N limited (R = 2.13), which resulted in a negative correlation between forest R and latitude. The degree of N limitation in the remainder of the tropical forest studies (R = 1.20) was comparable to that of temperate forests, and when the young Hawaiian subgroup was excluded, forest R did not vary with latitude. Grassland response increased with latitude, but was independent of temperature and precipitation. These results suggest that the global N and C cycles interact strongly and that geography can mediate ecosystem response to N within certain biome types. {\textcopyright} 2008 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {Although the effects of chemical fertilization management on microbial communities in soils have been well studied, few studies have examined such impacts of long-term chemical fertilizations on the microbial community in black soils common to northeast China. We applied high-throughput pyrosequencing and quantitative PCR of the 16S rRNA gene to investigate bacterial communities in a long-term fertilizer experiment started in 1980. The following fertilizer treatments were compared with control plots (no fertilizer): N1 (low nitrogen fertilizer), N2 (high nitrogen fertilizer), N1P1 (low nitrogen plus low phosphorus fertilizers) and N2P2 (high nitrogen plus high phosphorus fertilizers). All fertilization treatments resulted in decreases in soil pH and increases in wheat yield and concentrations of total nitrogen, organic matter and KCl-extractable NO3- and NH4+. Fertilization also led to a significant decrease in total 16S rRNA gene abundance and bacterial diversity. The phyla Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria and Actinobacteria dominated in all fertilized treatments. There was an increase in relative abundance of Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, TM7 and Verrucomicrobia across all fertilized treatments compared to unfertilized controls, whereas phyla Acidobacteria and Nitrospirae decreased. The bacterial communities in unfertilized controls and lower-mineral fertilizers (i.e. N1 and N1P1) were predominantly composed of Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria, and separated from the communities where more concentrated fertilizer regimes were used (i.e. N2 and N2P2) based on principal coordinates analysis. Soil pH and NO3- concentration appeared to be the most important factors in shaping bacterial communities. Our findings suggested that long-term inorganic fertilizer regimes reduced the biodiversity and abundance of bacteria. The influence of more concentrated fertilizer treatments was greater than that of lower concentrations.},

The aim of this work was to assess the impact of fertilization regime on wheat rhizosphere microbiome assembly and 16S rRNA gene-predicted functions with soil from the long term Broadbalk experiment at Rothamsted Research. Soil from four N fertilization regimes (organic N, zero N, medium inorganic N and high inorganic N) was sown with seeds of Triticum aestivum cv. Cadenza. 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing was performed with the Illumina platform on bulk soil and rhizosphere samples of 4-week-old and flowering plants (10 weeks). Phylogenetic and 16S rRNA gene-predicted functional analyses were performed. Fertilization regime affected the structure and composition of wheat rhizosphere bacterial communities. Acidobacteria and Planctomycetes were significantly depleted in treatments receiving inorganic N, whereas the addition of high levels of inorganic N enriched members of the phylum Bacteroidetes, especially after 10 weeks. Bacterial richness and diversity decreased with inorganic nitrogen inputs and was highest after organic treatment (FYM). In general, high levels of inorganic nitrogen fertilizers negatively affect bacterial richness and diversity, leading to a less stable bacterial community structure over time, whereas, more stable bacterial communities are provided by organic amendments. 16S rRNA gene-predicted functional structure was more affected by growth stage than by fertilizer treatment, although, some functions related to energy metabolism and metabolism of terpenoids and polyketides were enriched in samples not receiving any inorganic N, whereas inorganic N addition enriched predicted functions related to metabolism of other amino acids and carbohydrates. Understanding the impact of different fertilizers on the structure and dynamics of the rhizosphere microbiome is an important step toward developing strategies for production of crops in a sustainable way.},

It is unclear how N affects the fungal community in this soil type, so a long-term fertilizer experiment was begun in 1980 and we applied 454 pyrosequencing and quantitative PCR to targeted fungal ITS genes. There were five treatments: control (no fertilizer), N1 (low nitrogen fertilizer), N2 (high nitrogen fertilizer), N1P1 (low nitrogen plus low phosphorus fertilizers) and N2P2 (high nitrogen plus high phosphorus fertilizers). Soil nutrient concentrations (Total N, Avail N, NO3-, NH4+, etc.) and ITS gene copy numbers increased, whereas soil pH and fungal diversity decreased in all the fertilized treatments. Relationships between soil parameters and fungal communities were evaluated. Dothideomycetes, Eurotiomycetes, Leotiomycetes, Sordariomycetes, and Agaricomycetes were the most abundant classes in all soils. Principal coordinates analysis showed that the fungal communities in the control and lower-fertilizer treatments clustered closely and were separated from communities where more concentrated fertilizers were used. Fungal diversity and ITS gene copy number were dependent on soil pH. Our findings suggested that long-term nitrogen and phosphorous fertilizer regimes reduced fungal biodiversity and changed community composition.

However, it is unclear whether the motility of these key bacteria is an important factor for the interactions between bacteria in drinking water, and, subsequently, in the formation of aggregates, which are precursors to biofilms. Thus, the role of the motility of one of these key bacteria, the Methylobacterium strain DSM 18358, was investigated in the interactions between bacteria in drinking water. The motility of pure Methylobacterium colonies was initially explored; if it was affected by the viscosity of substrate, the temperature, the available energy and the type of substrate. Furthermore, the role of Methylobacterium in the interactions between mixed drinking water bacteria was investigated under the mostly favourable conditions for the motility of Methylobacterium identified before. Overall, the motility of Methylobacterium was found to play a key role in the communication and interactions between bacteria in drinking water. Understanding the role of the motility of key bacteria in drinking water might be useful for the water industry as a potential tool to control the formation of biofilms in drinking water pipes.},

abstract = {In bacteria, the sodium ion (Na+) cycle plays a critical role in negotiating the challenges of an extremely alkaline and sodium-rich environment. Alkaliphilic bacteria that grow optimally at high pH values use Na+ for solute uptake and flagellar rotation because the proton (H+) motive force is insufficient for use at extremely alkaline pH. Only three types of electrically driven rotary motors exist in nature: the F-type ATPase, the V-type ATPase, and the bacterial flagellar motor. Until now, only H+ and Na+ have been reported as coupling ions for these motors. Here, we report that the alkaliphilic bacterium Bacillus alcalophilus Vedder 1934 can grow not only under a Na+-rich and potassium ion (K+)-poor condition but also under the opposite condition in an extremely alkaline environment. In this organism, swimming performance depends on concentrations of Na+, K+ or Rb+. In the absence of Na+, swimming behavior is clearly K+- dependent. This pattern was confirmed in swimming assays of stator-less Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli mutants expressing MotPS from B. alcalophilus (BA-MotPS). Furthermore, a single mutation in BA-MotS was identified that converted the naturally bi-functional BA-MotPS to stators that cannot use K+ or Rb+. This is the first report that describes a flagellar motor that can use K+ and Rb+ as coupling ions. The finding will affect the understanding of the operating principles of flagellar motors and the molecular mechanisms of ion selectivity, the field of the evolution of environmental changes and stresses, and areas of nanotechnology. {\textcopyright} 2012 Terahara et al.},

This method, UniFrac, measures the phylogenetic distance between sets of taxa in a phylogenetic tree as the fraction of the branch length of the tree that leads to descendants from either one environment or the other, but not both. UniFrac can be used to determine whether communities are significantly different, to compare many communities simultaneously using clustering and ordination techniques, and to measure the relative contributions of different factors, such as chemistry and geography, to similarities between samples. We demonstrate the utility of UniFrac by applying it to published 16S rRNA gene libraries from cultured isolates and environmental clones of bacteria in marine sediment, water, and ice. Our results reveal that (i) cultured isolates from ice, water, and sediment resemble each other and environmental clone sequences from sea ice, but not environmental clone sequences from sediment and water; (ii) the geographical location does not correlate strongly with bacterial community differences in ice and sediment from the Arctic and Antarctic; and (iii) bacterial communities differ between terrestrially impacted seawater (whether polar or temperate) and warm oligotrophic seawater, whereas those in individual seawater samples are not more similar to each other than to those in sediment or ice samples. These results illustrate that UniFrac provides a new way of characterizing microbial communities, using the wealth of environmental rRNA sequences, and allows quantitative insight into the factors that underlie the distribution of lineages among environments.

Yet, seminal questions remain largely unaddressed including whether and how the rhizosphere microbiome modulates root metabolism and exudation and, consequently, how plants fine tune this complex belowground web of interactions. Here we show that, through a process termed systemically induced root exudation of metabolites (SIREM), different microbial communities induce specific systemic changes in tomato root exudation. For instance, systemic exudation of acylsugars secondary metabolites is triggered by local colonization of bacteria affiliated with the genus Bacillus. Moreover, both leaf and systemic root metabolomes and transcriptomes change according to the rhizosphere microbial community structure. Analysis of the systemic root metabolome points to glycosylated azelaic acid as a potential microbiome-induced signaling molecule that is subsequently exuded as free azelaic acid. Our results demonstrate that rhizosphere microbiome assembly drives the SIREM process at the molecular and chemical levels. It highlights a thus-far unexplored long-distance signaling phenomenon that may regulate soil conditioning.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015, FAC UNIV SCIENCES AGRONOMIQUES GEMBLOUX. All rights reserved. Description of the subject. The present study concerns the relationships among leaf litter decomposition, substrate quality, ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) community composition and nitrogen (N) availability. Decomposition of organic matter affects the biogeochemical cycling of carbon (C) and N. Since the composition of the soil microbial community can alter the physiological capacity of the community, it is timely to study the litter quality effect on N dynamic in ecosystems. Objectives. The aim of this study was to determine the influence of leaf litter decomposition on N mineralization. The specific objectives of this study were to evaluate the influence of the litter biochemistry of fiv e plants species (Faidherbia albida A.Chev., Azadirachta indica A.Juss., Casuarina equisetifolia L., Andropogon gayanus Kunth and Eragrostis tremula Hochst. ex Steud.) on N mineralization in a tropical ferrous soil (Lixisol), nitrification, and genetic diversity of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of amplified fragments of genes coding for 16S rRNA was used to study the development of bacterial communities during decomposition of leaf litter in soils. Method. Community structure of AOB was determined at two time periods: day 0 and day 140. Ten strains were tested and each of these strains produced a single band. Thus, DGGE DNA band patterns were used to estimate bacterial diversity. Plant secondary compounds such as polyphenols are purported to influence nutrient cycling by affecting organic matter degradation, mineralization rates, N availability and humus formation. In a laboratory study, we investigated the influence of six phenolic acids (ferulic, gallic, vanillic, syringic, p-coumaric and p-HBA acids) commonly found in the plant residues on N mineralization and NH < sup > + < /sup > < inf > 4 < /inf >  and NO < inf > 3 < /inf > - production in soils. Results. The results showed that litter type did affect soil nitrification. Faidherbia albida litter was associated with increased inorganic N in soil after 140 days of incubation while A. gayanus and C. equisetifolia litter immobilized N. Azadirachta indica and E. tremula amendments had no significant effects in N mineralization. The results show that the addition of six phenolic acids significantly reduced NH < sup > + < /sup > < inf > 4 < /inf >  and NO < inf > 3 < /inf > - compared to the control soil but had no significant effect on N mineralization. For the community of ammonium-oxidizing bacteria, a litter quality effect was noted, but the incubation time effect was more pronounced, except for C. equisetifolia litter. Conclusions. Results confirmed that the N mineralization changed with litter type under controlled conditions and the genetic structure of AOB is highly dependent on litter quality.},

abstract = {Biotic interactions in the rhizosphere are biologically important, and although many of those interactions have been well studied, the role of secreted proteins in the cross-talk between microbes and roots has not been investigated. Here, protein secretion was studied during the communication between the roots of two plants (Medicago sativa and Arabidopsis thaliana) and the bacterial symbiont of one of these species (Sinorhizobium meliloti strain Rm1021) and an opportunistic bacterial pathogen of A. thaliana (Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000) using a proteomic approach. It was found that protein exudation in the M. sativa-S. meliloti interaction caused an increase in the secretion of seven plant proteins, such as hydrolases, peptidases, and peroxidases among others in two or more time points compared with the plant control. In addition, four proteins, all of bacterial origin, were increased 1.5-fold more in this interaction compared with S. meliloti alone. However, these proteins were not induced when M. sativa was inoculated with P. syringae DC3000. The interaction between A. thaliana and P. syringae DC3000 highly induced the secretion of several plant proteins related to defense soon after initial contact with P. syringae, but these proteins were not secreted in the incompatible interaction with S. meliloti. The results of this study reveal a specific, protein level cross-talk between roots and microbes. These results suggest that secreted proteins may be a critical component in the process of signaling and recognition that occurs between compatible and incompatible interactions. {\textcopyright} 2008 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

abstract = {The effects of global N enrichment on soil processes in grassland ecosystems have received relatively little study. We assessed microbial community response to experimental increases in N availability by measuring extracellular enzyme activity (EEA) in soils from three grasslands with contrasting edaphic and climatic characteristics: a semiarid grassland at the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge, New Mexico, USA (SEV), and mesic grasslands at Konza Prairie, Kansas, USA (KNZ) and Ukulinga Research Farm, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa (SAF). We hypothesized that, with N enrichment, soil microbial communities would increase C and P acquisition activity, decrease N acquisition activity, and reduce oxidative enzyme production (leading to recalcitrant soil organic matter [SOM] accumulation), and that the magnitude of response would decrease with soil age (due to higher stabilization of enzyme pools and P limitation of response). Cellulolytic activities followed the pattern predicted, increasing 35-52% in the youngest soil (SEV), 10-14% in the intermediate soil (KNZ) and remaining constant in the oldest soil (SAF). The magnitude of phosphatase response did not vary among sites. N acquisition activity response was driven by the enzyme closest to its pH optimum in each soil: i.e., leucine aminopeptidase in alkaline soil, $\beta$-N-acetylglucosaminidase in acidic soil. Oxidative enzyme activity varied widely across ecosystems, but did not decrease with N amendment at any site. Likewise, SOM and %C pools did not respond to N enrichment. Between-site variation in both soil properties and EEA exceeded any treatment response, and a large portion of EEA variability (leucine aminopeptidase and oxidative enzymes), 68% as shown by principal components analysis, was strongly related to soil pH (r = 0.91, P < 0.001). In these grassland ecosystems, soil microbial responses appear constrained by a molecular-scale (pH) edaphic factor, making potential breakdown rates of SOM resistant to N enrichment. {\textcopyright} 2007 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Bacterial adhesion is the initial step in colonization and biofilm formation. Biofilms can, on the one hand, be detrimental to both human life and industrial processes, for example, causing infection, pathogen contamination, and slime formation, while on the other hand, be beneficial in environmental technologies and bioprocesses. For control and utilization of bacterial adhesion and biofilms, adhesion mechanisms must be elucidated. Conventional physicochemical approaches based on Lifshitz-van der Waals, electrostatic and acid-base interactions provide important models of bacterial adhesion but have a limited capacity to provide a complete understanding of the complex adhesion process of real bacterial cells. In conventional approaches, bacterial cells, whose surfaces are structurally and chemically heterogeneous, are often described from the viewpoint of their overall cellular properties. Cell appendages such as polysaccharide chains and proteinous nanofibers have an important function bridging between cells and the substratum in conventional adhesion models, but sometimes cause deviation from the models of cell adhesion. In reality, cell appendages are responsible for specific and nonspecific cell adhesion to biotic and abiotic surfaces. This paper reviews conventional physicochemical models and cell appendage-mediated cell adhesion. State-of-the-art technologies for controlling microbial adhesion and biofilm formation are also described. These technologies are based on the adhesion mechanisms. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {In this study, the selection of bacteria on the basis of their migration via fungal hyphae in soil was investigated in microcosm experiments containing Lyophyllum sp. strain Karsten (DSM2979). One week following inoculation with a bacterial community obtained from soil, selection of a few specific bacterial types was noticed at 30 mm in the growth direction of Lyophyllum sp. strain Karsten in sterile soil. Cultivation-based analyses showed that the migration-proficient types encompassed 10 bacterial groups, as evidenced by (GTG)5 genomic fingerprinting as well as 16S rRNA gene sequencing. These were (>97% similarity) Burkholderia terrae BS001, Burkholderia sordidicola BS026, Burkholderia sediminicola BS010, and Burkholderia phenazinium BS028; Dyella japonica BS013, BS018, and BS021; "Sphingoterrabacterium pocheensis" BS024; Sphingobacterium daejeonense BS025; and Ralstonia basilensis BS017. Migration as single species was subsequently found for B. terrae BS001, D. japonica BS018 and BS021, and R. basilensis BS017. Typically, migration occurred only when these organisms were introduced at the fungal growth front and only in the direction of hyphal growth. Migration proficiency showed a one-sided correlation with the presence of the hrcR gene, used as a marker for the type III secretion system (TTSS), as all single-strain migrators were equipped with this system and most non-single-strain migrators were not. The presence of the TTSS stood in contrast to the low prevalence of TTSSs within the bacterial community used as an inoculum (<3%). Microscopic examination of B. terrae BS001 in contact with Lyophyllum sp. strain Karsten hyphae revealed the development of a biofilm surrounding the hyphae. Migration-proficient bacteria interacting with Lyophyllum sp. strain Karsten may show complex behavior (biofilm formation) at the fungal tip, leading to their translocation and growth in novel microhabitats in soil. {\textcopyright} 2009, American Society for Microbiology.

abstract = {A sensitivity-resistance index was developed, and proved to be a very sensitive biomonitor of soil pollution with heavy metals. The index was developed by a step-by-step approach. Ultimately, the bacterial soil microflora was divided into three groups, senstivive, tolerant, and resistant microflora. Zn and Cd sensitivity was defined as no growth occurring in the presence of 5 and 0.5 mg l-1 of these metals, respectively, while resistance was defined as distinct growth in the presence of 50 and 16 mg l-1, respectively. The sensitivity: resistance ratio of a referent clay soil (0.57 mg Cd kg-1 and 140 mg Zn kg-1) was 0.53, but for polluted (6 mg Cd kg-1 + 670 mg Zn kg-1) clay soil, the ratio was 0.24. For a referent (0.06 mg Cd kg-1 + 12 mg Zn kg-1) sandy soil the sensitivity: resistance ratio was 1.50 whereas polluted (2.3 mg Cd kg-1 + 252 mg Zn kg-1) sandy soil had a ratio 0.19. The ecological value of the sensitivity-resistance lies in its capacity to reflect potential deradation of aromatic compounds. It has been shown repeatedly that sensitive bacteria grow significantly better on a range of selected aromatic compounds. It has been speculated that resistance fo heavy metals may reduce the bioremediation capacity of soil towards chlorinated aromatics and polyaromatic hydrocarbons. {\textcopyright} 1994 Springer-Verlag.},

Internal structures, such as the cytoskeleton and gas vesicles, are involved in some types of motility, whereas the mechanisms of some other types of movement remain mysterious. Regardless of the type of motility machinery that is employed, most motile microorganisms use complex sensory systems to control their movements in response to stimuli, which allows them to migrate to optimal environments.},

abstract = {Bacterial mobility in unsaturated soils plays an important role in bioremediation, biofacilitated transport of pollutants, and dispersal of pathogenic microorganisms. A sand column equipped with ports for measuring water pressure and water saturation has been used to study bacterial transport under well-defined unsaturated flow conditions. Bacterial breakthrough curves at various water saturations were obtained for two soil bacteria. Retention of hydrophobic Rhodococcus sp. C125 and mesohydrophilic Pseudomonas putida mt2 was markedly increased at lower water saturation. A mechanistic model for bacterial transport under unsaturated conditions is proposed. The model attributes stronger bacterial retention under unsaturated conditions to the accumulation of bacteria at the air-water interface. Moreover, the model takes into account changes in the available surface areas of both the solid surface and the air-water interface due to coverage by bacteria and changes in the water flow. Application of the model to our own data and data from the literature showed that short-term breakthrough experiments can be simulated, but that the model deviates from experimental observation in long-term experiments. Reasons for this deviation are discussed, and suggestions for a further model extension are made. All investigated colloidal particles had a higher affinity to the air-water interface than to the solid surface. There, trapping of bacteria by air- water interfaces is an important process possibly controlling bacterial transport in unsaturated soils.},

abstract = {How might a microbial cell that is entirely metabolically dormant – and which has the ability to remain so for extended periods of time – irreversibly commit itself to resuming vegetative growth within seconds of being exposed to certain amino acids or sugars? That this process takes place in the absence of any detectable ATP or de novo protein synthesis, and relies upon a pre-formed apparatus that is immobilised, respectively, in a semi-crystalline membrane or multi-layered proteinaceous coat, only exacerbates the challenge facing spores of Bacillales species when stimulated to germinate. Whereas the process by which spores are formed in response to nutrient starvation – sporulation – involves the orchestrated interplay between hundreds of distinct proteins, the process by which spores return to life – germination – is a much simpler affair, requiring a handful of receptor and channel proteins complemented with specialized peptidoglycan lysins. Despite this relative simplicity, and research effort spanning many decades, comprehensive understanding of key molecular and biochemical details and, in particular signal transduction mechanisms associated with spore germination, has remained elusive. In this review we provide an up to date overview of the field while identifying what we consider to be the key gaps in knowledge associated with germination of Bacillales spores, suggesting also technical approaches that may provide fresh insight to this unique biological process.},

However, the general response of species richness to N deposition across different vegetation types, soil conditions, and climates remains largely unknown even though responses may be contingent on these environmental factors. We assessed the effect of N deposition on herbaceous richness for 15,136 forest, woodland, shrubland, and grassland sites across the continental United States, to address how edaphic and climatic conditions altered vulnerability to this stressor. In our dataset, with N deposition ranging from 1 to 19 kg N{\textperiodcentered}ha-1{\textperiodcentered}y-1, we found a unimodal relationship; richness increased at low deposition levels and decreased above 8.7 and 13.4 kg N{\textperiodcentered}ha-1{\textperiodcentered}y-1 in open and closed-canopy vegetation, respectively. N deposition exceeded critical loads for loss of plant species richness in 24% of 15,136 sites examined nationwide. There were negative relationships between species richness and N deposition in 36% of 44 community gradients. Vulnerability to N deposition was consistently higher in more acidic soils whereas the moderating roles of temperature and precipitation varied across scales. We demonstrate here that negative relationships between N deposition and species richness are common, albeit not universal, and that fine-scale processes can moderate vegetation responses to N deposition. Our results highlight the importance of contingent factors when estimating ecosystem vulnerability to N deposition and suggest that N deposition is affecting species richness in forested and nonforested systems across much of the continental United States.},

However, how cells efficiently regulate their locomotion movements is still unclear. Since migration is also a crucial issue in cancer development, the goal of this narrative is to show the connection between basic findings in cell locomotion of unicellular eukaryotic organisms and the regulatory mechanisms of cell migration necessary for tumor invasion and metastases. More specifically, the review focuses on three main issues, (i) the regulation of the locomotion system in unicellular eukaryotic organisms and human cells, (ii) how the nucleus does not significantly affect the migratory trajectories of cells in two-dimension (2D) surfaces and (iii) the conditioned behavior detected in single cells as a primitive form of learning and adaptation to different contexts during cell migration. New findings in the control of cell motility both in unicellular organisms and mammalian cells open up a new framework in the understanding of the complex processes involved in systemic cellular locomotion and adaptation of a wide spectrum of diseases with high impact in the society such as cancer.},

abstract = {It is frequently hypothesised that high soil fungal/bacterial ratios are indicative for more sustainable agricultural systems. Increased F / B ratios have been reported in extensively managed grasslands. To determine the shifts in fungal/bacterial biomass ratio as influenced by grassland management and to find relations with nitrogen leaching potential, we sampled a two-year-old field experiment at an organic experimental farm in the eastern part of The Netherlands. The effect of crop (grass and grass-clover), N application rate (0, 40, 80, 120 kg N ha- 1) and manure type (no manure, farm yard manure and slurry) on the F / B ratio within three growing seasons was tested, as well as relations with soil and crop characteristics, nitrate leaching and partial N balance. Biomass of fungi and bacteria was calculated after direct counts using epifluorescence microscopy. Fungal and bacterial biomass and the F / B ratio were higher in grass than in grass-clover. The F / B ratio decreased with increasing N application rate and multiple regression analysis revealed a negative relationship with pH. Bacterial activity (measured as incorporation of [3H]thymidine and [14C]leucine into bacterial DNA and proteins) showed the exact opposite: an increase with N application rate and pH. Leaching increased with N application rate and was higher in grass-clover than in grass. Partial N balance was more positive at a higher N application rate and showed an inverse relationship with fungal biomass and F / B ratio. We conclude that the fungal/bacterial biomass ratio quickly responded to changes in management. Grasslands with higher N input showed lower F / B ratios. Grass-clover had a smaller fungal biomass and higher N leaching than grass. In general, a higher fungal biomass indicated a lower nitrogen leaching and a more negative partial N balance (or smaller N surplus), but more observations are needed to confirm the relationship between F / B ratio and sustainability. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The land application of animal manure can introduce manure microbiome and resistome to croplands where food crops are grown. The objective of this study was to characterize the microbiome and resistome on and in the leaves of lettuce grown in manured soil and identify the main transmission routes of microbes and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) from soil to the episphere and endosphere of lettuce. Shotgun metagenomic results show that manure application significantly altered the composition of the microbiome and resistome of surface soil. SourceTracker analyses indicate that manure and original soil were the main source of the microbiome and resistome of the surface soil and rhizosphere soil, respectively. Manure application altered the microbiome and resistome in the episphere of lettuce (ADONIS p < 0.05), and surface soil accounted for ∼81% of the microbes and ∼62% of the ARGs in episphere. Manure application had limited impacts on the microbiome and resistome in the endosphere (ADONIS p > 0.05).

abstract = {There is a concerted understanding of the ability of root exudates to influence the structure of rhizosphere microbial communities. However, our knowledge of the connection between plant development, root exudation and microbiome assemblage is limited. Here, we analyzed the structure of the rhizospheric bacterial community associated with Arabidopsis at four time points corresponding to distinct stages of plant development: seedling, vegetative, bolting and flowering. Overall, there were no significant differences in bacterial community structure, but we observed that the microbial community at the seedling stage was distinct from the other developmental time points. At a closer level, phylum such as Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Cyanobacteria and specific genera within those phyla followed distinct patterns associated with plant development and root exudation. These results suggested that the plant can select a subset of microbes at different stages of development, presumably for specific functions. Accordingly, metatranscriptomics analysis of the rhizosphere microbiome revealed that 81 unique transcripts were significantly (P<0.05) expressed at different stages of plant development. For instance, genes involved in streptomycin synthesis were significantly induced at bolting and flowering stages, presumably for disease suppression. We surmise that plants secrete blends of compounds and specific phytochemicals in the root exudates that are differentially produced at distinct stages of development to help orchestrate rhizosphere microbiome assemblage. {\textcopyright} 2014 International Society for Microbial Ecology All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The phylogenetic and functional diversities of microbial communities in tropical rainforests and how these differ from those of temperate communities remain poorly described but are directly related to the increased fluxes of greenhouse gases such as nitrous oxide (N2O) from the tropics. Toward closing these knowledge gaps, we analyzed replicated shotgun metagenomes representing distinct life zones and an elevation gradient from four locations in the Luquillo Experimental Forest (LEF), Puerto Rico. These soils had a distinct microbial community composition and lower species diversity compared to those of temperate grasslands or agricultural soils. In contrast to the overall distinct community composition, the relative abundances and nucleotide sequences of N2O reductases (nosZ) were highly similar between tropical forest and temperate soils. However, respiratory NO reductase (norB) was 2-fold more abundant in the tropical soils, which might be relatable to their greater N2O emissions. Nitrogen fixation (nifH) also showed higher relative abundance in rainforest than in temperate soils, i.e., 20% versus 0.1 to 0.3% of bacterial genomes in each soil type harbored the gene, respectively. Finally, unlike temperate soils, LEF soils showed little stratification with depth in the first 0 to 30 cm, with ∼45% of community composition differences explained solely by location. Collectively, these results advance our understanding of spatial diversity and metabolic repertoire of tropical rainforest soil communities and should facilitate future ecological studies of these ecosystems. IMPORTANCE Tropical rainforests are the largest terrestrial sinks of atmospheric CO2 and the largest natural source of N2O emissions, two greenhouse gases that are critical for the climate. The microbial communities of rainforest soils that directly or indirectly, through affecting plant growth, contribute to these fluxes remain poorly described by cultured-independent methods. To close this knowledge gap, the present study applied shotgun metagenomics to samples selected from three distinct life zones within the Puerto Rico rainforest. The results advance our understanding of microbial community diversity in rainforest soils and should facilitate future studies of natural or manipulated perturbations of these critical ecosystems.},

Using high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing and relative importance for linear regression, we explored how the structures of soil bacterial community were influenced by the environmental factors and restoration succession of secondary forests in the Miyaluo Mountains of western Sichuan, China. Using a space-for-time approach, field measurements and sampling were conducted in four stands at different stages of natural restoration. Results of distance-based multivariate analysis showed that soil pH, organic carbon, available phosphorus, and C/N ratio were the predominant environmental factors that collectively explained a 46.9% variation in the bacterial community structures. The community compositions were jointly controlled by the direct and indirect effects of the rehabilitation stages. The changes in soil environmental factors coincided with restoration succession could lead to the shifts in the relative abundance of different soil bacterial taxa. We screened 13 successional discriminant taxa that could quantitatively indicate the secondary succession subalpine stage. Collectively, our findings show that soil bacteria in different taxa are governed by different local soil variables and rehabilitation ages, which can lead to shifts in the relative abundance of different taxa in successional stages, ultimately changing the entire soil bacterial community with the succession of secondary forest.},

abstract = {Bacterial motility was recognized 300 years ago. Throughout this history, research into motility has led to advances in microbiology and physics. Thirty years ago, this union helped to make run and tumble chemotaxis the paradigm for bacterial movement. This review highlights how this paradigm has expanded and changed, and emphasizes the following points. The absolute magnitude of swimming speed is ecologically important because it helps determine vulnerability to Brownian motion, sensitivity to gradients, the type of receptors used and the cost of moving, with some bacteria moving at 1 mm s-1. High costs for high speeds are offset by the benefit of resource translocation across submillimetre redox and other environmental gradients. Much of environmental chemotaxis appears adapted to respond to gradients of micrometres, rather than migrations of centimetres. In such gradients, control of ion pumps is particularly important. Motility, at least in the ocean, is highly intermittent and the speed is variable within a run. Subtleties in flagellar physics provide a variety of reorientation mechanisms. Finally, while careful physical analysis has contributed to our current understanding of bacterial movement, tactic bacteria are increasingly widely used as experimental and theoretical model systems in physics. {\textcopyright} 2005 Federation of European Microbiological Societies Published by Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Emerging studies have demonstrated that Streptomyces spores are distributed through various mechanisms, but it remains unclear how spores are transported to their preferred microenvironments, such as plant roots. Here, we show that Streptomyces spores are capable of utilizing the motility machinery of other soil bacteria. Motility assays and microscopy studies reveal that Streptomyces spores are transported to plant tissues by interacting directly with the flagella of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Genetics experiments demonstrate that this form of motility is facilitated by structural proteins on the spore coat.

This review focuses on the molecular basis underlying the phenotypes of three beneficial microbe groups; (1) plant-growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR), (2) root nodulating bacteria (RNB), and (3) biocontrol agents (BCAs). We focus on bacterial proteins and secondary metabolites that mediate known phenotypes within and around plants, and the mechanisms used to secrete these. We highlight the necessity for a better understanding of bacterial genes responsible for beneficial plant traits, which can be used for targeted gene-centered and molecule-centered discovery and deployment of novel beneficial rhizobacteria.},

abstract = {With the advent of glyphosate [N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine] tolerant crops, soils have now been receiving repeated applications of the herbicide for over 10 years in the Midwestern USA. There is evidence that long-term use of glyphosate can cause micronutrient deficiency but little is known about plant potassium (K) uptake interactions with glyphosate. The repeated use of glyphosate may create a selection pressure in soil microbial communities that could affect soil K dynamics and ultimately K availability for crops. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to characterize the effect of foliar glyphosate applied to GR (glyphosate resistant) soybeans on: (1) rhizosphere microbial community profiles using ester linked fatty acid methyl ester (EL-FAME) biomarkers, (2) exchangeable, non-exchangeable, and microbial K in the rhizosphere soil, and (3) concentrations of soybean leaf K. A greenhouse study was conducted in a 2×2×3 factorial design with two soil treatments (with or without long-term field applications of glyphosate), two plant treatments (presence and absence of soybean plants), and three rates of glyphosate treatments (0×, 1× at 0.87, and 2× at 1.74kg aeha -1, the recommended field rate). After each glyphosate application, rhizosphere soils were sampled and analyzed for microbial community structure using ester linked fatty acid methyl ester biomarkers (EL-FAME), and exchangeable, plant tissue and microbial biomass K. Glyphosate application caused a significant decrease in the total microbial biomass in soybean rhizosphere soil that had no previous exposure to glyphosate, at 7 days after glyphosate application. However, no significant changes were observed in the overall microbial community structure. In conclusion, the glyphosate application lowered the total microbial biomass in the GR soybean rhizosphere soil that had no previous exposure to glyphosate, at 7 days after glyphosate application; caused no changes in the microbial community structure; and did not reduce the plant available K (soil exchangeable or plant tissue K). {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier GmbH.},

These microbial communities and their associated genes - collectively termed the root microbiome - are diverse and have been shown to play an important role in conferring abiotic stress tolerance to their plant hosts. In light of growing concerns over the threat of water and nutrient stress facing terrestrial ecosystems, especially those used for agricultural production, increased emphasis has been placed on understanding how abiotic stress conditions influence the composition and functioning of the root microbiome and the ultimate consequences for plant health. However, the composition of the root microbiome under abiotic stress conditions will not only reflect shifts in the greater bulk soil microbial community from which plants recruit their root microbiome but also plant responses to abiotic stress, which include changes in root exudate profiles and morphology. Exploring the relative contributions of these direct and plant-mediated effects on the root microbiome has been the focus of many studies in recent years. Here, we review the impacts of abiotic stress affecting terrestrial ecosystems, specifically flooding, drought, and changes in nitrogen and phosphorus availability, on bulk soil microbial communities and plants that interact to ultimately shape the root microbiome. We conclude with a perspective outlining possible directions for future research needed to advance our understanding of the complex molecular and biochemical interactions between soil, plants, and microbes that ultimately determine the composition of the root microbiome under abiotic stress.},

Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the role of root exudates in the colonization of PGPR. Banana root exudates were analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) which revealed exudates contained several organic acids (OAs) including oxalic, malic and fumaric acid. The chemotactic response and biofilm formation of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens NJN-6 were investigated in response to OA's found in banana root exudates. Furthermore, the transcriptional levels of genes involved in biofilm formation, yqxM and epsD, were evaluated in response to OAs via quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Results suggested that root exudates containing the OAs both induced the chemotaxis and biofilm formation in NJN-6. In fact, the strongest chemotactic and biofilm response was found when 50$\mu$M of OAs were applied. More specifically, malic acid showed the greatest chemotactic response whereas fumaric acid significantly induced biofilm formation by a 20.7-27.3% increase and therefore biofilm formation genes expression. The results showed banana root exudates, in particular the OAs released, play a crucial role in attracting and initiating PGPR colonization on the host roots.},

abstract = {Anthropogenic nitrogen (N) enrichment of many ecosystems throughout the globe has important ramifications for plant communities. Observational and experimental studies frequently find species richness declines with N enrichment, in concert with increasing primary production. Nitrogen enrichment also reorders species composition, including species turnover through gains and losses of species, changes in dominance and rarity, and shifts in the relative abundance of particular functional groups. Nitrogen has traditionally been considered the primary limiting nutrient for plant growth in terrestrial ecosystems, but recent synthetic work suggests that colimitation by phosphorus (P), water, and other resources is widespread, consistent with theoretical predictions. At the same time, disproportionate increases in ecosystem N input are expected to exacerbate limitation by P and other resources. Similarly, synthetic research has pointed out the important role of consumers and pathogens in determining plant community structure, especially with respect to shifting resource availability. We argue here that environmental and biotic contexts, including limitation by multiple resources, herbivores and pathogens, play important roles in our understanding of plant community responses to N enrichment. {\textcopyright} 2010 New York Academy of Sciences.},

However, our knowledge of the influence of nitrogen (N) and/or phosphorus (P) inputs on belowground microbial communities in subtropical forests is still unclear. In this study, we used quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Illumina Miseq sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene to investigate bacterial abundance, diversity, and community composition in a Chinese fir plantation. The fertilization regimes were as follows: untreated control (CK), P amendment (P), N amendment (N), and N with P amendment (NP). Additions of N decreased soil pH and bacterial 16S rRNA gene abundance by 3.95 (from 4.69 to 3.95) and 3.95 × 109 copies g-1 dry soil (from 9.27 × 109 to 3.95 × 109 g-1 dry soil), respectively. Bacterial richness and diversity decreased with N addition (N and NP) rather than only P input. Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, and Actinobacteria were the major phylum across all treatments. Nitrogen addition increased the relative abundance of Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria by 42.0 and 10.5%, respectively, while it reduced that of Acidobacteria by 26.5%. Bacterial community structure in the CK and P treatments was different from that in the N and NP treatments upon principle coordinates analysis. Phosphorus addition did not significantly affect soil bacterial communities, and no interactions between N and P inputs on microbial traits were observed. Soil pH and mineral N availability appeared to have a cooperative effect on bacterial abundance and community structure, with soil pH being the key influencing factor by canonical correspondence analysis. These results indicate that inorganic N rather than P fertilization affected both bacterial abundance and community composition in subtropical forests.},

abstract = {Mineral phosphorus (P) fertilizers support high crop yields and contribute to feeding the teeming global population. However, complex edaphic processes cause P to be immobilized in soil, hampering its timely and sufficient availability for uptake by plants. The resultant low use efficiency of current water-soluble P fertilizers creates significant environmental and human health problems. Current practices to increase P use efficiency have been inadequate to curtail these problems. We advocate for the understanding of plant physiological processes, such as physiological P requirement, storage of excess P as phytate, and plant uptake mechanisms, to identify novel ways of designing and delivering P fertilizers to plants for improved uptake. We note the importance and implications of the contrasting role of micronutrients such as zinc and iron in stimulating P availability under low soil P content, while inhibiting P uptake under high P fertilization; this could provide an avenue for managing P for plant use under different P fertilization regimes. We argue that the improvement of the nutritional value of crops, especially cereals, through reduced phytic acid and increased zinc and iron contents should be among the most important drivers toward the development of innovative fertilizer products and fertilization technologies. In this paper, we present various pathways in support of this argument. Retuning P fertilizer products and application strategies will contribute to fighting hunger and micronutrient deficiencies in humans. Moreover, direct soil P losses will be reduced as a result of improved P absorption by plants.},

abstract = {The well-being of the microbial community that densely populates the rhizosphere is aided by a plant's root exudates. Maintaining a plant's health is a key factor in its continued existence. As minute as rhizospheric microbes are, their importance in plant growth cannot be overemphasized. They depend on plants for nutrients and other necessary requirements. The relationship between the rhizosphere-microbiome (rhizobiome) and plant hosts can be beneficial, non-effectual, or pathogenic depending on the microbes and the plant involved. This relationship, to a large extent, determines the fate of the host plant's survival. Modern molecular techniques have been used to unravel rhizobiome species' composition, but the interplay between the rhizobiome root exudates and other factors in the maintenance of a healthy plant have not as yet been thoroughly investigated. Many functional proteins are activated in plants upon contact with external factors. These proteins may elicit growth promoting or growth suppressing responses from the plants. To optimize the growth and productivity of host plants, rhizobiome microbial diversity and modulatory techniques need to be clearly understood for improved plant health.},

abstract = {Background: We recently described FastTree, a tool for inferring phylogenies for alignments with up to hundreds of thousands of sequences. Here, we describe improvements to FastTree that improve its accuracy without sacrificing scalability. Methodology/Principal Findings: Where FastTree 1 used nearest-neighbor interchanges (NNIs) and the minimum-evolution criterion to improve the tree, FastTree 2 adds minimum-evolution subtree-pruning-regrafting (SPRs) and maximum-likelihood NNIs. FastTree 2 uses heuristics to restrict the search for better trees and estimates a rate of evolution for each site (the "CAT" approximation). Nevertheless, for both simulated and genuine alignments, FastTree 2 is slightly more accurate than a standard implementation of maximum-likelihood NNIs (PhyML 3 with default settings). Although FastTree 2 is not quite as accurate as methods that use maximum-likelihood SPRs, most of the splits that disagree are poorly supported, and for large alignments, FastTree 2 is 100-1,000 times faster. FastTree 2 inferred a topology and likelihood-based local support values for 237,882 distinct 16S ribosomal RNAs on a desktop computer in 22 hours and 5.8 gigabytes of memory. Conclusions/Significance: FastTree 2 allows the inference of maximum-likelihood phylogenies for huge alignments.

abstract = {Motility could be an important adaptation of heterotrophic bacteria and archaea, and it may have ecological and biogeochemical implications. However, the limited observations so far show that only a small fraction (≤10%) of bacteria is motile. We report a systematic 10 mo long field study off the coast of La Jolla, California, as well as a mesocosm study to examine bacterial motility and its relationship to environmental variables. Dark-field microscopy revealed periods of sustained low (fall and winter, <5 to 25%) and high (spring and summer, 40 to 70%) percentages of motile bacteria (% motile). Bacteria in natural seawater did not swim constantly nor at constant speeds; over 40% swam < 20% of the time, and showed bursts of motility. Percent motile showed a distinct diel pattern and was not significantly correlated with tidal cycle, chlorophyll a, or the abundance of algae, bacteria, and heterotrophic nanoflagellates. However, it was positively related with particulate organic carbon throughout diel sampling on 24 to 26 September 1997. During a mesocosm diatom bloom % motile rose sharply as the bloom crashed, suggesting algal detritus may elicit motility. Enhanced % motile resulted in increased colonization of living and dead algal cells by bacteria. Filtering seawater through a 1 pm filter reduced % motile, again suggesting the importance of particulate loci. Enrichment with dissolved organic nutrients enhanced % motile only after 6 h but it rapidly (≤1 h) increased the time individual bacteria were swimming. Our results show that a variable fraction of marine bacteria is able to respond to loci of organic matter, e.g. organic particles and algae, and that motility underlies dynamic patterns of ecological relationships (symbiosis, competition, parasitism) between bacteria and algae. Since motility may enhance bacteria-organic-matter coupling it is likely to be an important variable in the oceanic carbon cycle.},

Our results indicated that both N and P application significantly affected plant height, root collar diameter, chlorophyll content, and root morphology. Among the nutrient levels, 10 g N and 8 g P were found to yield maximum growth, and the maximum values of plant height, root collar diameter, chlorophyll content, and root morphology were obtained when 10 g N and 8 g P were used together. Therefore, the present study demonstrates that optimum levels of N and P can be used to improve seedling health and growth during the nursery period.},

abstract = {Plant species is considered to be one of the most important factors in shaping rhizobacterial communities, but specific plant-microbe interactions in the rhizosphere are still not fully understood. Arabidopsis thaliana, for which a large number of naturally occurring ecotype accessions exist, lacks mycorrhizal associations and is hence an ideal model for rhizobacterial studies. Eight Arabidopsis accessions were found to exert a marked selective influence on bacteria associated with their roots, as determined by terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) and ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (RISA). Community differences in species composition and relative abundance were both significant (P <0.001). The eight distinct and reproducible accession-dependent community profiles also differed from control bulk soil. Root exudates of these variants were analysed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to try to establish whether the unique rhizobacterial assemblages among accessions could be attributed to plant-regulated chemical changes in the rhizosphere. Natural variation in root exudation patterns was clearly exhibited, suggesting that differences in exudation patterns among accessions could be influencing bacterial assemblages. Other factors such as root system architecture are also probably involved. Finally, to investigate the Arabidopsis rhizosphere further, the phylogenetic diversity of rhizobacteria from accession Cvi-0 is described.},

abstract = {Plant health in natural environments depends on interactions with complex and dynamic communities comprising macro- and microorganisms. While many studies have provided insights into the composition of rhizosphere microbiomes (rhizobiomes), little is known about whether plants shape their rhizobiomes. Here, we discuss physiological factors of plants that may govern plant–microbe interactions, focusing on root physiology and the role of root exudates. Given that only a few plant transport proteins are known to be involved in root metabolite export, we suggest novel families putatively involved in this process. Finally, building off of the features discussed in this review, and in analogy to well-known symbioses, we elaborate on a possible sequence of events governing rhizobiome assembly. Recent advances in sequencing technology have been enabling high-throughput characterization of highly complex plant-associated microbial communities, which are relevant for plant health. Metagenomic approaches have been identifying the metabolic potential of microbes, and are starting to reveal functional groups of microbes, reducing the overall complexity of rhizobiomes. Metabolomic studies are uncovering differential root exudation in various environments and plant developmental stages, as well as consumption of specific exometabolites by microbes. Genome-wide association studies and other comparative genomic approaches have been revealing a link between plant genetic factors, exudation profiles, and microbiome compositions. Molecular studies have been characterizing plant transport proteins necessary for interactions with specific microbes, although the transport of most nutrients and signaling molecules remains unexplored.},

The soybean rhizosphere has a specific microbial community, yet whether these organisms affect rhizobial nodulation has not been well investigated. Here, we analyzed the compositions and relationships of soybean rhizocompartment microbiota in three types of soil. First, we found that the rhizosphere community composition of soybean varied significantly in different soils, and the association network between rhizobia and other rhizosphere bacteria was examined. Second, we found that some rhizosphere microbes were correlated with the composition of bradyrhizobia and sinorhizobia in nodules. We cultivated 278 candidate Bacillus isolates from alkaline soil. Finally, interaction and nodulation assays showed that the Bacillus cereus group specifically promotes and suppresses the growth of sinorhizobia and bradyrhizobia, respectively, and alleviates the effects of saline–alkali conditions on the nodulation of sinorhizobia as well as affecting its colonization in nodules. Our findings demonstrate a crucial role of the bacterial microbiota in shaping rhizobia–host interactions in soybean, and provide a framework for improving the symbiotic efficiency of this system of mutualism through the use of synthetic bacterial communities.},

abstract = {Background: Rhizosphere microbial communities are key regulators of plant performance, yet few studies have assessed the impact of different management approaches on the rhizosphere microbiomes of major crops. Rhizosphere microbial communities are shaped by interactions between agricultural management and host selection processes, but studies often consider these factors individually rather than in combination. We tested the impacts of management (M) and rhizosphere effects (R) on microbial community structure and co-occurrence networks of maize roots collected from long-term conventionally and organically managed maize-tomato agroecosystems. We also explored the interaction between these factors (M × R) and how it impacts rhizosphere microbial diversity and composition, differential abundance, indicator taxa, co-occurrence network structure, and microbial nitrogen-cycling processes. Results: Host selection processes moderate the influence of agricultural management on rhizosphere microbial communities, although bacteria and fungi respond differently to plant selection and agricultural management. We found that plants recruit management-system-specific taxa and shift N-cycling pathways in the rhizosphere, distinguishing this soil compartment from bulk soil. Rhizosphere microbiomes from conventional and organic systems were more similar in diversity and network structure than communities from their respective bulk soils, and community composition was affected by both M and R effects. In contrast, fungal community composition was affected only by management, and network structure only by plant selection. Quantification of six nitrogen-cycling genes (nifH, amoA [bacterial and archaeal], nirK, nrfA, and nosZ) revealed that only nosZ abundance was affected by management and was higher in the organic system. Conclusions: Plant selection interacts with conventional and organic management practices to shape rhizosphere microbial community composition, co-occurrence patterns, and at least one nitrogen-cycling process. Reframing research priorities to better understand adaptive plant-microbe feedbacks and include roots as a significant moderating influence of management outcomes could help guide plant-oriented strategies to improve productivity and agroecosystem sustainability.},

Here, we used barcoded pyrosequencing to comprehensively survey archaeal and bacterial communities in 146 soils, representing a multitude of soil and ecosystem types from across the globe. Relative archaeal abundance, the percentage of all 16S rRNA gene sequences recovered that were archaeal, averaged 2% across all soils and ranged from 0% to 10% in individual soils. Soil C:N ratio was the only factor consistently correlated with archaeal relative abundances, being higher in soils with lower C:N ratios. Soil archaea communities were dominated by just two phylotypes from a constrained clade within the Crenarchaeota, which together accounted for 70% of all archaeal sequences obtained in the survey. As one of these phylotypes was closely related to a previously identified putative ammonia oxidizer, we sampled from two long-term nitrogen (N) addition experiments to determine if this taxon responds to experimental manipulations of N availability. Contrary to expectations, the abundance of this dominant taxon, as well as archaea overall, tended to decline with increasing N. This trend was coupled with a concurrent increase in known N-oxidizing bacteria, suggesting competitive interactions between these groups. {\textcopyright} 2011 International Society for Microbial Ecology All rights reserved.},

Amplicon-based sequencing of marker genes, such as 16S rRNA, is a powerful tool for assessing and comparing the structure of microbial communities at a high phylogenetic resolution. Because 16S rRNA sequencing is more cost-effective than whole metagenome shotgun sequencing, marker gene analysis is frequently used for broad studies that involve a large number of different samples. However, in comparison to shotgun sequencing approaches, insights into the functional capabilities of the community get lost when restricting the analysis to taxonomic assignment of 16S rRNA data. Results: Tax4Fun is a software package that predicts the functional capabilities of microbial communities based on 16S rRNA datasets. We evaluated Tax4Fun on a range of paired metagenome/16S rRNA datasets to assess its performance. Our results indicate that Tax4Fun provides a good approximation to functional profiles obtained from metagenomic shotgun sequencing approaches.},

Understanding how fertilization and plant species affect soil bacterial community diversity and composition is the key for understanding the role of soil bacteria in sustainable agriculture. To study the response of soil bacteria to different fertilization and cropping managements, a 3-year (2013–2015) field study was established. In the split-plot design, fertilizer treatment (unfertilized control, organic fertilizer, and synthetic fertilizer) was the main plot factor, and plant treatment [clear fallow, red clover (Trifolium pratense), timothy (Phleum pratense), and a mixture of red clover and timothy] was the sub-plot factor. Soil bacterial community diversity and composition, soil properties, and crop growth were investigated through two growing seasons in 2014 and 2015, with different nitrogen input levels. The community diversity measures (richness, Shannon diversity, and Shannon evenness) and composition changed over time (P < 0.05) and at different time scales. The community diversity was lower in 2014 than in 2015. The temporal differences were greater than the differences between treatments.

The major differences in diversity and community composition were found between fallow and planted treatments and between organic and synthetic fertilizer treatments. The differences between the planted plots were restricted to individual operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Soil moisture, total carbon content, and total nitrogen content correlated consistently with the community composition (P < 0.05). Compared to the unfertilized control, the nitrogen fertilizer loading enhanced the temporal change of community composition in pure timothy and in the mixture more than that in red clover, which further emphasizes the complexity of interactions between fertilization and cropping treatments on soil bacteria.},

The interaction mechanism between plant and rhizosphere microorganisms is one of the hotspots in life science research and the key program of agricultural microorganism utilization. In this article, the relationship among plant root morphology and physiology, rhizosphere microorganisms, and nitrogen is reviewed, summarized, and prospected.},

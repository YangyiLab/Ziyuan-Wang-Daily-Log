## Projects
### Relationship in plant genome between G4 and other gene components
A G4 motif is composed of at least four stems, each including three or more guanines, and stems are separated by loops in- cluding one to 12 unspecified nucleotides, leading to the consensus motif sequence of $G_{3+}N_{1−12}G_{3+}N_{1−12}G_{3+}N_{1−12}G_{3+}$. A G4 structure is formed on the G-rich DNA strand of the motif because of stacking of guanine stems in quartets (or quadruplexes) held together by Hoogsten hydrogen bonds. The G4 structure map of the human genome has been constructed based on HG38, and we want to extend this idea to plants and analyze some plant specific genetic elements.
### Phage Classifier & Annoation 
Phage genome has always been a research focus of virus science, but there is no perfect solution to the annotation of phage genome, the current general method is to use prokaryotic genome annotation tool for annotation. But there will be a large number of false recessive, missing some important overlapping genes and short genes. Or tools such as Phanotate screen for too many gene segments, which can produce a large number of false positives.
In addition, for different phage genome types, single and double chains are not considered, and there is still a lack of related tools for viral metagenomic annotation, most of which are suitable for whole-genome annotation. Also, we try to reduce the high FP rate. Therefore, we propose a pipeline that classifies fragments and then annotates them based on the fragment information.
### Combined analysis of mouse metabolome and Chinese medicine metabolome
Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has a long history and has always been regarded as a national treasure by Chinese people. However, in order to further the effectiveness of traditional Chinese medicine, we constructed mice with gynecological diseases through animal models and treated them with Traditional Chinese medicine. The efficacy of the treatment was confirmed by the combined analysis of mouse metabolome, Chinese medicine mass spectrometry and drug network.
### Microbiome shows there is a recovery 
Ten-year recovery of forest soil microorganisms in a secondary forest by metagenomic analysis.
The introduction of new cash crops after cutting down the plants in the original forest may cause ecological damage, but our research shows that the ecological damage is short-term and can be recovered within ten years.
In Guangzhou, we found that changing the primary forest to a secondary forest of camphor trees restored the soil flora in summer, but the recovery effect was not enough in winter.
Studies included routine 16S ecological diversity analysis, as well as metagenome-related pathway enrichment analysis.
### Soil nitrogen impacts the rhizosphere microbial community owing to microbial hitchhiking
Abtract: Nitrogen fertilizer has a significant impact on the soil microbial community; however, the underlying mechanism force is not clear. Three levels of nitrogen fertilizer, base (H1), +20% (H2), and +40% (H3), were applied to plants (Spinacia oleracea L.) in sterile soils able or unable to undergo microbial exchange with ambient soils. The exchange was blocked using a 0.45-μm membrane. In the no-membrane treatments, the greatest plant biomass was observed in H2, followed by H3 and H1. A composition analysis indicated that the motile bacteria (Bacillus) content in the rhizosphere bacterial community was lower in H2 than in H1 and H3. Furthermore, a functional analysis demonstrated that the cell motility level in H2 was relatively low in both the bulk soil and rhizosphere bacterial community, which was consistent with the trends at different nitrogen levels. The correlation between bulk soil motile bacteria (Bacillus and Gammaproteobacteria) and rhizosphere bacteria was weak in H2. In the membrane treatments, the plant biomass, and the microbial community composition, structure and functional abundance did not vary significantly at different nitrogen levels, but they were significantly different compared with no-membrane treatments at the same nitrogen level. Interestingly, the correlation between bulk soil motile bacteria and rhizosphere microbial community was weak at all nitrogen levels in comparison with the no-membrane treatments. Thus, we concluded that the application of different nitrogen doses altered the rhizosphere microbiome, thereby affecting plant growth because of the influence on microbial hitchhiking.
### SaAlign a multi-server MSA tool
Abstract: Multiple DNA/RNA sequence alignment is an important fundamental tool in bioinformatics, especially for phylogenetic tree construction. With DNA-sequencing improvements, the amount of bioinformatics data is constantly increasing, and various tools need to be iterated constantly. Mitochondrial genome analyses of multiple individuals and species require bioinformatics software; therefore, their performances need to be optimized. To improve the alignment of ultra-large datasets and ultra-long sequences, we optimized a dynamic programming algorithm using longest common substring methods. Ulatra-arge test DNA datasets, containing sequences of different lengths, some over 300 kb (kilobase), revealed that the Multiple DNA/RNA Sequence Alignment Tool Based on Suffix Tree (SaAlign) saved time and computational space. It outperformed the existing technical tools, including MAFFT and HAlign-II. For mitochondrial genome datasets having limited numbers of sequences, MAFFT performed the required tasks, but it could not handle ultra-large mitochondrial genome datasets. We implement a multiple DNA/RNA sequence alignment tool based on Center Star strategy and use suffix array algorithm to optimize the spatial and time efficiency. Nowadays, whole-genome research and NGS technology are becoming more popular, and it is necessary to save computational resources for laboratories. That software is of great significance in these aspects, especially in the study of the whole-mitochondrial genome of plants.
